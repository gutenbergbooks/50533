<p class="chaptitle">NEW FRIENDS AND NEW FORTUNES.</p>


<p>"What next?"</p>

<p>Not often does a boy put that question to himself and
receive an answer as quickly as Motor Matt received his.</p>

<p>The king of the motor boys was out among the sand
dunes on the Presidio Military Reservation. He had
started to walk to the old fort at the Golden Gate, but
had dropped down on one of the sand heaps, thinking&mdash;a
little moodily, it must be admitted&mdash;over his present
situation, and what lay ahead.</p>

<p>It was a fine morning. The sky was pale blue and
without a cloud, and the bay was as blue as indigo. The
trade wind blew over him, and tempered the heat, and the
salt tang in the air reminded him of the long voyage
around the Horn which he and his chums had completed
no more than a week before.</p>

<p>Alcatraz was so close that it almost seemed to Matt as
though he could take a running jump from the shore
and clear the intervening stretch of water, and beyond
Alcatraz, like a purple pyramid, arose Tamalpais, looking
westward across the Pacific.</p>

<p>Matt was gloomy because, early that morning, he had
separated from his two chums, Dick Ferral and Carl
Pretzel. Dick had received a telegram from his uncle,
in Denver, asking him to come east at once. At his invitation,
Carl had gone with him. Both lads urged Matt
to accompany them, but he had declined, thinking more
seriously than he had ever done of some "prep" school
and a course at Leland Stanford. If he was to take that
step, seeking new friends and new fortunes, why not
take it now?</p>

<p>There was something more in life, Matt told himself,
than just knocking around the world, meeting all kinds
of trouble and getting the upper hand of it.</p>

<p>But there were the motors, the explosive engines Matt
loved so well, and had worked among so long. If he entered
some academy, he would have to turn his back on
the humming cylinders, the rushing wheels, and the
racing propellers.</p>

<p>That thought gave him a pang. The gasoline motor
was just coming into its own, and the field that lay before
it was so wide as to stagger the imagination. Could Matt
tear himself away from the fascination of terminals, commutators
and spark plugs, from differential and transmission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
gear, from spray nozzles and float feeds, from the
steady explosion, the perfect mixture of air and gasoline,
the humming of the coils, and the beautifully balanced
reciprocity of a running motor?</p>

<p>Well, after a while, perhaps, but not&mdash;not right away.</p>

<p>"What next?" he asked himself.</p>

<p>"Huh!" came a sound, half-grunt and half-greeting,
from directly in front of him.</p>

<p>During his reflections, Matt's head had bowed forward
and his eyes had fixed themselves vacantly on the gray
sand. He raised his glance abruptly, and saw within a
yard of him a young fellow in dingy sombrero, faded blue
flannel shirt, and corduroy trousers.</p>

<p>The lad could not have been more than seventeen. His
face was tanned a deep bronze, and his eyes were as black
as midnight. His nose was what is termed a "snub," and
gave his face a droll, humorous look. As he slouched in
front of Matt he had his hands in his pockets.</p>

<p>For a full minute Matt and the stranger surveyed each
other.</p>

<p>"Huh!" said the stranger again, pulling a hand out
of his pocket to jerk the brim of his hat down over one
eye. "Got any sand?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Sand?" echoed Matt.</p>

<p>"Sure&mdash;s-a-n-d, sand. I'm game as a hornet myself,
and I reckon I can lay holt of you and wind you up like
an eight-day clock. Say, try me a whirl, catch-as-catch-can.
If I can't put you on your back in a brace of
shakes, I'll eat my spurs. Dare you!"</p>

<p>The stranger backed off, and pushed up his sleeves. A
wide grin crossed his face and his black eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>"What have you got against me?" asked Matt. "Why
do you want to fight?"</p>

<p>"Shucks! You got to have a reason for every blamed
thing? Come at me. Dare you&mdash;dare you! I'm hungry
to caper&mdash;and you ain't going to hold back on a feller
when he's <i>hungry</i>, are you?"</p>

<p>Matt laughed.</p>

<p>"Well, no," he answered, getting up.</p>

<p>Then, without any ifs, ands, or whyfors, the king of
the motor boys and the stranger rushed together.</p>

<p>It was the "double grapevine" that did the business for
the stranger. In ten seconds, by the watch, he went into
the air and dropped down on the soft sand with a <i>chug</i>
that left him dazed and bewildered. Then he sat up and
stared.</p>

<p>"Well, well, well!" he sputtered. He was still grinning,
and his black eyes traveled over Matt with wonder
and admiration. "You the Tur'ble Turk in disguise?" he
inquired.</p>

<p>"Hardly," laughed Matt. "You must have learned
wrestling in an Agricultural School."</p>

<p>"Mebby," answered the other, picking himself up,
"but I ain't diving into my wannegan any, at that. You
can't give me another jolt like that, pard. Two out of
three, you know. First fall for the gent in the leather
cap&mdash;but the next one's mine. Whoop-ee!"</p>

<p>The stranger, bareheaded and sleeves rolled to his elbows,
rushed at Matt like a hurricane. Matt side-stepped,
whirled, caught his antagonist from behind and shouldered
him like a bag of meal. The next instant he had
dropped him, and squirmed out from under his gripping
fingers.</p>

<p>"Gee, man!" gasped the stranger, rubbing his hand
over his eyes. "Speak to me about that, oh, <i>do</i>! He lifts
me up and sets me down, and all my caperin' don't
amount to shucks. Ain't it scandalous to be hip-locked
with like that?"</p>

<p>"Got enough?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"Plenty, <i>amigo</i>." The stranger climbed to his feet,
picked up his hat and reflectively slapped the sand out
of it. "Down where I come from, a feller can 'most always
tell when he's got enough. When did you break
out on this part of the map?"</p>

<p>"A week ago."</p>

<p>"What label do you tote?"</p>

<p>"King, Matt King."</p>

<p>The strange youth came within one of dropping his
hat.</p>

<p>"Speak to me about <i>that</i>!" he gasped, his eyes widening.
"Why, I might as well have wrestled with a locomotive
and tried to stand it on its headlight in the right
of way! Say, I've read about <i>you</i>! You're the king of
the motor boys&mdash;the big high boy who brought that submarine
around South Americy, and turned her over to
Uncle Sam here in 'Frisco. <i>Gracias!</i>"</p>

<p>"What are you thanking me for?"</p>

<p>"Because you could have tied me into a bowknot and
tossed me into the bay&mdash;and you didn't. Next time I
hip-lock with a cyclone I hope somebody will put a tag
on me and ship me to an asylum for the feeble-minded.
My name's McGlory, Joe McGlory, and when I'm to
home I hang up my lid in Tucson. Shake, Motor Matt.
You sure stack up pretty high with me."</p>

<p>"Glad to know you, McGlory," said Matt, highly edified,
giving the youth's hand a cordial pressure. "Is it
your custom to take a fall out of every acquaintance you
make?"</p>

<p>"Well, it's sort of satisfyin', when you make friends
with a galoot, to know which is the best man. It shows
you what he's got in him that you can depend on in a
pinch, see? I reckon you think I've got everything but
the long ears, eh? Don't make a mistake about that, pard.
I'm not so foolish as you might think. Tell me something!"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"While you've been in 'Frisco have you seen anything
of a feller about my heft and height, scar an inch long
over his right eyebrow, answerin' to the name of George
Lorry?"</p>

<p>Matt shook his head.</p>

<p>"Haven't seen him," he answered. "Are you looking
for a fellow answering that description?"</p>

<p>"I am, a heap."</p>

<p>The grin, which seemed almost perpetual on McGlory's
face, faded into an earnest expression as he mentioned
the lad he was looking for.</p>

<p>"Did you come to this reservation looking for him?"
went on Matt.</p>

<p>"Nary, pard." McGlory faced the boy, and waved his
hand toward the life-saving station ahead, and to the left
of them, on the shore. "I'm mortal fond of boats," he
went on. "Kind of queer, that, don't you think, for a
galoot that's passed pretty near his whole life in the mines
and in the cattle ranges? Anyway, that's me. I can't
cross the ferry without gettin' seasick, but, all the same,
everything that floats tickles me more than I can tell.
I've been down to the life-saving station looking at the
surf boat."</p>

<p>"I'm fond of boats myself," said Matt, "especially motor
boats. There's something on the ground that must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
belong to you, McGlory," he added, pointing to the sand
near where McGlory had fallen, the first time.</p>

<p>The young cowboy looked at the object, and then recovered
it with a whoop. The object was a small, oblong
square of pasteboard.</p>

<p>"It's a ticket for the raffle," McGlory explained.
"There's two hundred of 'em out, and I've got sixty."</p>

<p>"Raffle?" queried Matt.</p>

<p>"Sure. A little old motor launch is goin' to be raffled
off, over at Tiburon, this afternoon. Say, that boat's
a streak! She can show her heels to anythin' in San
Francisco Bay. Speak to me about that, will you! I've
got sixty chances out of two hundred for baggin' her.
Come over with me to the raffle, pard. I've cottoned to
you, and you're my style from the ground up. What
say?"</p>

<p>"Can you run a motor launch?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"Don't know the first thing about it."</p>

<p>"What do you want with such a boat, then, if it makes
you seasick to ride on the water, and if you don't know
how to run a motor?"</p>

<p>"Shucks! Whenever I get a notion I play it up strong,
no matter whether there's any reason in it or not. That's
Joe McGlory from spurs to headpiece, and everybody in
Tucson will tell you the same. Are you with me, Matt?
If you are, we'll slide back through the reservation, and
jump the cars."</p>

<p>Matt had already conceived a liking for young McGlory.
There was something mysterious about him, and
a mystery is always attractive.</p>

<p>A few moments later the king of the motor boys was
strolling along the old board walk between the big
Presidio barracks and the row of officers' houses, side by
side with his new friend.</p>

<p>New friends and new fortunes, ran his thoughts. How
were they to turn out, and what were they to be?</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE RAFFLE.</p>


<p>"There she is, Matt; and it's apples to ashes she's the
fastest thing that floats. Why, she can run like a scared
coyote makin' for home and mother. I've seen her perform,
pard, and when she goes any place she arrives
just before she starts. Speak to me about that, please.
Squint at her good and hard, and tell me what you
think."</p>

<p>Motor Matt and Joe McGlory had eaten their dinner
at a restaurant in Market Street, and had caught the
one-o'clock boat across the bay to Tiburon. It was now
a quarter to two, and they were standing on a small
wharf, not far from the ferry landing, looking down on a
trim little boat. There were about a dozen others, men
and boys, lounging on the wharf. The raffle was to come
off at two, and most of the idlers, presumably, had bought
tickets, and were waiting to "put their fortune to the
touch."</p>

<p>The boat was an eighteen-footer, some three feet beam,
and looked as though she could "git up and git" if enough
ginger were thrown into her propeller. She was in
charge of a boy who had let her drift out to the end of a
ten-foot painter.</p>

<p>"Pull her in," called Matt to the boy. "I'd like to look
at her engine."</p>

<p>The boy laid hold of the painter, and drew the boat up
alongside the wharf. Matt dropped into her, and lifted
one side of the hinged hood that protected the motor.</p>

<p>He found that the engine consisted of two horizontal
opposed cylinders, and was as neat, simple, and compact a
marine motor as any he had ever seen. The gasoline tank
was in the nose of the boat.</p>

<p>"Ten horse power," mused Matt.</p>

<p>"You've struck it," said the boy.</p>

<p>After a five-minute examination the only fault Matt
had to find with the machinery lay in the reversing gear.
The brake band was not properly adjusted, but was set
so that it dragged on the drum, which could hardly fail
to result in a reduction of speed.</p>

<p>When Matt climbed up on the wharf again McGlory
met him with an eager question as to what he thought
of the <i>Sprite</i>, which was the name of the little craft.</p>

<p>"She's all right," answered Matt, "and ought to run
like a singed cat."</p>

<p>"Worth a couple of hundred plunks?"</p>

<p>"The motor alone is worth a hundred and fifty, and
seems to be as good as new."</p>

<p>"Whoop!" exulted McGlory. "Somebody's going to
get her for a cartwheel&mdash;one single, solitary piece of the
denomination of eight bits. Mebby it's me? <i>Quien
sabe?</i>"</p>

<p>"There were two hundred tickets, you say, and they
were sold at a dollar each?"</p>

<p>"Keno, correct, and then some."</p>

<p>"And you have sixty tickets, Joe?"</p>

<p>"Again your bean is on the right number, pard."</p>

<p>"Well, if you get the boat she will have cost you sixty
dollars."</p>

<p>"But it's only one ticket out of the sixty that wins her,
Matt. Fifty-nine plunks are squandered, and it's one big
dollar that pulls her down to me. I'd have bought more,
if I'd had the <i>dinero</i>."</p>

<p>"I might take a chance myself," observed Matt, "although
I haven' any more use for a motor launch here
in 'Frisco than has a stray cowboy by the name of McGlory."</p>

<p>"Nary, you won't, Matt," said McGlory. "Tickets are
all gone."</p>

<p>"What in the world are you going to do with the craft
if you win her?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell how nervous you make me, wanting a reason
for every blooming thing. The notion hit me plumb
between the eyes, Matt, and that's all there is to it. But
if I can't use the <i>Sprite</i> I can sell her, can't I? And if
I did want to go cruising, I've got you to run her for
me! Oh, speak to me about that. But," and here McGlory's
face fell, "I'm not going to get her. Johnny
Hardluck has been running neck and neck with me ever
since I was knee-high to a clump of cactus. If I'd have
bought a hundred and ninety-nine tickets, the pasteboard
I failed to corral would be the one that bobbed up when
the wheel stopped runnin'. That's me, but I'm so plumb
locoed that I keep trying to bust this hard-luck blockade.
What's that&mdash;a twenty-dollar gold piece?"</p>

<p>Matt had stooped down while McGlory was talking,
and picked up a flat object from the ground in front of
him.</p>

<p>"A baggage check," answered Matt. "Some of the
crowd here must have dropped it. If we could find&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>Just then, a man appeared carrying his derby hat in his
hand. The hat was filled with numbered slips.</p>

<p>"Gents," called the man, "this here drawin' for the
<i>Sprite</i> is now a-goin' to take place. Somebody's a-goin'
to get that little streak o' greased lightnin' for a dollar.
She's a good boat, an' wouldn't be sold for twice two
hundred if her owner hadn't tumbled into a stretch of
hard luck. She's done her mile in four minutes, the
<i>Sprite</i> has, right here in the bay. This here hat is filled
with slips o' paper numbered from one to two hundred,
like the tickets. One of 'em's goin' to be drawed by the
kid, who'll be blindfolded for the occasion. The lucky
number the kid first pulls from the hat takes the boat."</p>

<p>Cheers from the assembled crowd greeted the "kid"
as he climbed out of the boat and allowed a handkerchief
to be tied over his eyes. Then, with much formality, and
while the breathless crowd watched, the youngster's
grimy hand went into the hat and pushed around wrist-deep
among the slips.</p>

<p>"If the feller that gets the boat lives over in 'Frisco,"
pursued the man, while the boy dallied provokingly with
the slips, "he won't have to wait for the next boat back.
All he's got to do is to jump into the <i>Sprite</i>, head her
where he wants to go, and cut loose. She's full o' oil and
gasoline, an' could go from here to Vallejo without takin'
on any more."</p>

<p>The boy's hand lifted from the hat and held up a slip.</p>

<p>"Number seventy-three," read the man; "number seventy-three
is the lucky ticket, an' gets the <i>Sprite</i>. Who's
got number seventy-three?"</p>

<p>"Stung again!" said McGlory gloomily, taking a handful
of tickets from his pocket and tossing them into the
air. "I might just as well say moo and chase myself.
Sixty <i>pesos</i> gone where the woodbine twineth, and McGlory's
got another lesson in the way luck's cut him
out of her herd. Mebby it's just as well. I've got about
as much use for a motor launch as a yaller dog for the
tin can tied to the end of his tail, but the notion that I
wanted the thing sure hit me hard."</p>

<p>"You ought to put a curb on those notions of yours,
Joe," said Matt. "They seem to be pretty expensive."</p>

<p>"Shucks! Well, I get a couple o' square miles of fun
nursing the notions along, anyways. It's hoping for
things that makes a feller feel good; he never steps so
high, wide, and handsome after he gets 'em. Now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Just here there came an excited chirp, followed by a
shrill cackle of joy. A Chinese boy, not more than fifteen
or sixteen, broke through the disappointed throng of
whites, his queue flying, and his blue silk blouse fluttering.</p>

<p>"My gottee! Hoop-a-la! My ticket him seventy-tlee!
My gottee chug-chug boatee."</p>

<p>"Happy days!" scowled McGlory, his eyes on the
young Chinaman. "If that washee-washee yaller mug
hasn't pulled down the prize I'm a sick Injun. And
here's me with sixty tickets, and him with only <i>one</i>!
Speak to me about that! What sort of a low-down thing
is luck, anyway, to pass up a respectable white, with sixty
chances, and dump that boat onto a Chink with only one!
Sufferin' sister! Let's go some place, Matt, where we
can be away from the crowd and by ourselves. I'm in
a mood for reflection&mdash;like old Jack Bisbee was when the
government mule kicked at him and set off a box of dynamite.
I've got it in the neck, as per usual, and I want
to say things to myself."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, Joe," returned Matt. "Let's watch
the Chinaman."</p>

<p>The man who had "bossed" the drawing examined the
Chinaman's ticket.</p>

<p>"It's seventy-three, all right," he remarked. "Where
you gettee, Charley?"</p>

<p>"'Melican man no gottee dol pay fo' laundry," the Celestial
answered; "him givee China boy ticket."</p>

<p>"It was sure a good play for you. There's your boat.
Take her."</p>

<p>The yellow boy ran down to the edge of the wharf,
dancing around in his wooden shoes, and crooning
ecstatically to himself.</p>

<p>"My gottee boat, my gottee boat! Hoop-a-la! Where
row sticks?" he demanded, turning to the man who had
been in charge of the raffle.</p>

<p>"That's a motor boat, Charley," grinned the man. "You
don't need any row sticks."</p>

<p>The yellow boy, still chattering to himself, slipped from
the wharf into the boat. One of the men, alive to the
humor of the situation, pulled the painter off the post and
threw it into the craft after him.</p>

<p>"How you makee lun?" inquired the new owner of the
<i>Sprite</i>, taking his seat at the steering wheel.</p>

<p>The bystanders began nudging each other in the ribs.
There was a delightful prospect ahead of them, in watching
this guileless Celestial, who knew nothing about motors,
trying to run a motor boat.</p>

<p>Half a dozen voices called down directions for switching
on the spark, starting the flow of gasoline, and getting
the engine to going.</p>

<p>"He'll get into trouble," cried Matt, pushing his way
through the crowd.</p>

<p>"What's the diff?" guffawed a blear-eyed individual,
with a husky laugh. "It's only a chink, anyhow."</p>

<p>Matt paid no attention to this remark.</p>

<p>"You'd better look out, Charley," he called to the
Chinaman.</p>

<p>"My gottee, you no gottee," the yellow boy answered.
"You no savvy China boy's pidgin; him savvy plenty fine.
Hoop-a-la!"</p>

<p>The motor began to pop, and then to settle down into
a steady hum. The China boy was fairly palpitating with
excitement. Grabbing at a lever, he threw the power into
the propeller and the <i>Sprite</i> jumped ahead along the
wharf, rubbing her gunwale against the planks. Frantically
the Celestial yanked at the steering wheel. The
<i>Sprite</i> turned her nose into the wharf and tried to climb
out of the water.</p>

<p>"She ain't no bubble wagon, chink!" roared the delighted
crowd; "don't bring her ashore!"</p>

<p>"Turn the wheel the other way!" shouted some one
else. "If we can head the rat-eater right, he'll go plumb
through the Golden Gate to China."</p>

<p>In the confusion of yells, the yellow boy caught the
suggestion and whirled the wheel the other way. In answer
to this sudden twist of the helm, the boat made a
hair-raising turn, going over so far that she almost
showed her garboard strake, then she flung away like a
race horse.</p>

<p>A group of three piles arose out of the water, half a
cable's length from the wharf. The <i>Sprite</i> caught them a
glancing blow. There was a terrific jolt, and those on
the landing had a glimpse of a Chinaman in the air, his
hat and sandals flying in three different directions. He
came down headfirst in fifteen feet of water, while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
<i>Sprite</i> sheered away from the piles and struck a bee line
for Sausalito.</p>

<p>Matt, seeing that disaster was sure to happen, had
jumped into a rowboat, and was bending to the oars.
There might be fun in baiting a Chinaman in that way,
but he could not see it.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">PING PONG OBJECTS.</p>


<p>Motor Matt's first intention was to fish the China boy
out of the water. He had barely started in the lad's direction,
however, when he saw McGlory teetering on the
edge of the wharf and throwing a rope.</p>

<p>"Whoosh!" gulped the China boy, as he bobbed to the
surface and laid hold of the rope. "No likee boatee! My
gottee, no wantee. Whoosh!"</p>

<p>Seeing that the lad was as good as rescued, Matt
turned his attention to the runaway launch. By some
freak of the steering gear the boat was cutting away in
a straight line.</p>

<p>The rowboat Matt had secured for the occasion had
been tied well to the south of the piles into which the
Chinese had run the <i>Sprite</i>. The launch, describing a
turn before she struck into a straightaway course, would
have to pass a point directly abreast of Matt.</p>

<p>By quick work with the oars he could reach the point
in time to lay hold of the launch.</p>

<p>Under his strong arms the rowboat leaped out across
the water, and then, with a quick push on one oar and an
equally quick pull on the other, the boat was laid broadside
on to the course the runaway <i>Sprite</i> was taking.</p>

<p>Not a second too soon was this accomplished. Hardly
had Matt dropped the oars when the <i>Sprite</i> came plunging
up beside him.</p>

<p>Leaning out over the side of the rowboat, he grabbed
the gunwale of the <i>Sprite</i>. Both boats were hauled together,
and the rowboat was towed along at a fierce clip&mdash;but
only for a moment.</p>

<p>Out of one boat and into the other Matt scrambled,
deftly avoiding the swamping of either craft. A minute
later he was at the steering wheel and the levers, and had
slowed down and turned the <i>Sprite</i> back.</p>

<p>Yells and cheers greeted his successful man&oelig;uvre;
and when he regained the wharf, towing the rowboat, a
dozen willing hands reached down to catch and secure
the painters.</p>

<p>"A dandy piece of work, you hear <i>me</i>!" bellowed one
of the crowd.</p>

<p>"You didn't expect Motor Matt to play lame duck
while pullin' off a trick like that, did you?" came the
voice of McGlory. "Shucks! that was as easy for him
as sitting in at grub pile."</p>

<p>"Say," cried the blear-eyed person, "is he the young
thunderbolt as brought that submarine around from the
Atlantic?"</p>

<p>"He's the chap."</p>

<p>This piece of information caused the crowd to develop
a tremendous amount of interest in the king of the motor
boys&mdash;more interest than he cared to claim.</p>

<p>"Where's the Chinaman, Joe?" he asked, with difficulty
extricating himself from the crowd, and making his way
to McGlory's side.</p>

<p>"Right here, Matt," answered the cowboy, leading the
way to a pile of old timber on which the dejected Celestial
was sitting. "He ain't feelin' quite as chipper as he was
a spell ago. 'Melican man's boatee didn't set well, and
he's got a bad attack of the blues."</p>

<p>"Hello, Charley!" exclaimed Matt, leaning forward
and slapping the yellow boy on his wet shoulder. "Where
do you want that boat? I'll take it across the bay for
you if that's where you want it to go."</p>

<p>"No wantee," was the doleful reply. "Him debble
boat; go sizz-sizz-sizzle, mebby so sendee China boy topside."</p>

<p>"But you've won it, and it's yours."</p>

<p>"No wantee," was the decided response. "My givee
you fi' dol you takee."</p>

<p>McGlory exploded a laugh and fell down the timbers.</p>

<p>"Speak to me about that, will you?" he gasped. "He's
willing to give you five dollars, Matt, to take the boat off
his hands."</p>

<p>The blear-eyed man pushed closer.</p>

<p>"See here, chink," said he, "don't you be a fool jest
because you got a chanst. What's the use of givin' a
feller money to take the boat? I'll give you a ten-dollar
bill for it, if that's the way you feel."</p>

<p>McGlory pulled himself off the pile of timber and
stepped in front of the man.</p>

<p>"I wonder if you wouldn't?" he scoffed.</p>

<p>"What's it to you, anyhow?" growled the man. "Who
give you any right to butt in? If the chink wants to sell
the boat I got a right to buy it."</p>

<p>"You ain't got a right to rob him, howsumever, and
I'm not going to loaf around with my hands in my
pockets and see you do it."</p>

<p>"Blather! What's a chink, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"A chap's got to be treated square," spoke up Matt,
"no matter whether his skin's white, black, or yellow."</p>

<p>"Look here, Charley," persisted the man, "I'll give you
fifty cold dollars for that boat."</p>

<p>"I'll give him seventy-five," put in another man. "If
the launch is going at a bargain I might as well hand over
a bid. What do you say, Charley?"</p>

<p>The China boy's little eyes began to snap and sparkle
as the idea of profit drifted through his head.</p>

<p>"Let them bid, Charley," said Matt. "I'll give you ten
dollars more than the highest bid they make."</p>

<p>This headed off any further attempt to get the better
of the Chinaman. After lingering in the vicinity for a
few minutes, the last of the crowd departed in the direction
of the ferry house.</p>

<p>"You takee boat," said the Chinaman to Matt. "You
ketchee, you takee. Huh?"</p>

<p>"For how much?" queried Matt. "I haven't any use
for the craft, Charley, and I was merely bidding to keep
those other fellows from robbing you."</p>

<p>"Wisht I had some money," muttered McGlory. "I'll
get a letter from Tucson in a day or two, and I reckon
it'll have a wad of <i>dinero</i> in it for me. Lend me enough
to buy that boat, Matt, and I'll fork over as soon as I
make the raise."</p>

<p>"I'd be glad to lend you money, Joe, for anything but
that," answered Matt. "You don't need the <i>Sprite</i> any
more than I do, so, if I don't lend you any funds you
can't buy the boat."</p>

<p>"That's just like a hired man, Matt, and not like a real
pard," mumbled McGlory. "But you're doing the right
thing, at that."</p>

<p>"Me allee same Ping Pong," piped up the Celestial,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
picking up the slack of his kimono and wringing the
water out of it. "Ah Choo makee lun launly, fire Ping
Pong, you savvy? Whoosh! My no gottee job allee
mo'."</p>

<p>"That's rough," commiserated the cowboy, with a wink
in Matt's direction. "Little Ping Pong here worked for
Ah Choo, and the old sneeze pulled the pin on him.
What was that for, Ping?"</p>

<p>"My takee ticket flom 'Melican man fol washee-washee,"
explained the China boy. "Ah Choo no likee;
him tellee Ping Pong makee skip, nevel come back allee
mo'."</p>

<p>"Listen to that!" went on McGlory. "A flat-faced
swatty owin' Ah Choo a dollar for the week's wash, blows
into the laundry emporium and trades a ticket on the raffle
with Ping Pong here for the amount of his debt.
When Ah Choo hears the particulars, he ditches Ping.
Ping comes over to Tiburon, wins the boat, and tries
to make it do a handspring over a clump of piles. Between
you and me, Matt, we pull him out of the briny
and save the boat, and here he is, worryin' because he's
out of a job and never thinking about the eighty-five
<i>pesos</i> that are bound to drop into his yellow palms!"</p>

<p>"China boy workee fo' you," chirped Ping Pong, reaching
out to grab Matt's hand. "You takee boat, givee Ping
Pong job."</p>

<p>"There's your chance," grinned McGlory. "Take on
the chink, Matt, and you corral the boat. It's no rhinecaboo
he's running in, either. He means every word of
it."</p>

<p>Matt's eyes wandered in the direction of the ferry
house.</p>

<p>"The next boat is about to leave," said he hurriedly.
"You take Ping and go on the boat, Joe, and I'll follow
you with the <i>Sprite</i>. You'll find me on the water front
near the foot of Clay Street. When we get back there
we'll find some way out of this difficulty. I haven't any
more use for the Chinaman than I have for the boat, but
I should think we could sell the boat for somewhere near
what she's worth and then turn the proceeds over to
Ping. That ought to keep him going until he finds a
job that suits him."</p>

<p>"Keno!" agreed McGlory, grabbing the Celestial by the
arm. "Come on, Ping, and we'll strike a bee line for the
ferry."</p>

<p>As they hurried off, Motor Matt returned to the landing
and to the <i>Sprite</i>. He was only a few moments casting
off and starting across the bay.</p>

<p>Destiny was lying in wait for him. Fate knows her
business, and never juggles events into such a state as
they were then without having a well-defined object in
view.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">ANOTHER RESCUE.</p>


<p>Matt fell in behind the big ferryboat as she moved out
of the slip and churned up the water in the direction of
San Francisco. Drawing back far enough to be clear
of the steamer's troubled wake, he jogged along, and
tried out the <i>Sprite</i> with various man&oelig;uvres calculated to
test her motor and her rough-weather qualities.</p>

<p>A keen delight ran tingling through every nerve as he
handled the steering wheel and manipulated the levers.
The engine worked perfectly; and, by flinging the little
craft ahead into the rough water thrown up by the
steamer, he was surprised and delighted at the easy work
she made of the big waves.</p>

<p>For a while, McGlory and Ping grouped themselves
aft and watched him. Every now and then the cowboy
would wave his hat and shout something which the distance
between the boats rendered indistinguishable to
Matt.</p>

<p>A tug came towing a two-masted ship in from the
Gate. Matt allowed the <i>Sprite</i> to fall off, so that the tug
and its tow would pass between him and the ferryboat.
As he headed westward in order to round the stern of
the sailing ship, Matt became suddenly aware that sailors
were running about the deck of the towed vessel, shouting
back and forth, and some of them hurrying to pick up
coils of rope. Abruptly the excitement ceased. The sailors
dropped their ropes, and two or three of them ran
up on the poop deck, waved their hands to Matt, and
pointed southward, along the track of the ferryboat.</p>

<p>Matt could not hear what the sailors shouted to him,
but from their gestures he knew there was something demanding
his attention on the other side of their vessel.
As the schooner gurgled and lurched past, Matt saw a
human form bobbing about in the water, and he also saw
that the ferryboat was in the act of putting about.</p>

<p>Waving a reassuring hand to the captain of the boat,
Matt forced the <i>Sprite</i> to her best speed, and laid a direct
course toward the struggling form. The captain of
the ferryboat, no doubt assuming that the launch would
easily effect a rescue, signaled his wheelman to keep on
across the bay.</p>

<p>As Matt steadily diminished the distance that separated
him from the form in the water, the form suddenly
vanished. With his eyes on the spot where it had gone
down, the young motorist was just making ready to shut
off the power and dive overboard when the form once
more shot to the surface.</p>

<p>"Keep afloat!" shouted Matt encouragingly, "I'm almost
alongside."</p>

<p>It was a young fellow, Matt could see that, and there
was despair in his face as he turned his head in response
to the call.</p>

<p>He tried to say something, but the words were lost in
a watery gurgle. His arms were working feebly, and it
was evident that he was nearly at the last gasp.</p>

<p>Coaxing the last ounce of speed out of the <i>Sprite</i>, Matt
laid her bow within a foot of the youth, then swiftly
shifted the wheel in order to bring the side of the launch
as close as possible.</p>

<p>Hanging to the wheel with one hand, Matt leaned outward
and downward, grabbing the collar of the youth's
sweater with his disengaged hand.</p>

<p>"Steady!" cried Motor Matt; "you'll be all right in a
minute."</p>

<p>Then, with a heave that caused the little boat to dip
at a dangerous angle, he hoisted the young fellow aboard
and dropped him splashing against the stern thwarts.</p>

<p>There was plenty of life in him, and Matt felt, just
then, that the boat required more attention than he did.
After getting the <i>Sprite</i> back on her proper course, Matt
slowed her speed and looked around.</p>

<p>The young fellow was sitting up in the bottom of the
boat, leaning back against the rear thwarts. He was about
Matt's own age, his hands were slender and white, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
his sweater, trousers, and shoes were of the most expensive
material.</p>

<p>"Did you ship much water?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"Not much," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Fall off the boat?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>The youth did not seem inclined to go into particulars.
When he answered Matt's question, he leaned over the
gunwale to peer around Matt and get a look at the ferryboat.</p>

<p>"She's going right on," he said, as though to himself;
"she won't stop to take me aboard."</p>

<p>"It won't be necessary for the ferryboat to stop," spoke
up Matt. "I've got you aboard, and that's enough."</p>

<p>The youth started, stared, and lifted one hand tremblingly
to his head.</p>

<p>"How did you happen to drop overboard?" inquired
Matt.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know," was the indefinite rejoinder. "I
just happened to, that's all. Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"To San Francisco&mdash;where you must have been going."</p>

<p>"Can't you put about and take me to Sausalito?"</p>

<p>The request surprised Motor Matt.</p>

<p>"Changed your mind about going to 'Frisco?"</p>

<p>"I don't want to go there. I want to go to Sausalito.
It don't make any difference to you where you land me,
does it?"</p>

<p>There was an arrogant, domineering air about the
youth, even in his present half-demoralized condition, that
struck the wrong kind of note in Matt's ears.</p>

<p>"It just happens," returned Matt, "that I'm to meet a
friend at the foot of Clay Street, and he'll probably be
waiting for me when I get there. I don't see how it
makes very much difference to you, when it's certain
you must have been going to the city when you dropped
off the ferryboat."</p>

<p>"Well," was the ungracious response, "it does make a
difference to me&mdash;a whole lot of difference. Will you
take me to Sausalito after you meet your friend?"</p>

<p>"I guess the ferryboat can do that for you," answered
Matt stiffly.</p>

<p>The strange youth had not had a word of thanks to
say to his rescuer, on the contrary, he was acting as
churlish as possible in the circumstances.</p>

<p>"I'm in a nice fix to ride on a ferryboat," grumbled
the young fellow, looking down at his soggy clothing
and his water-logged shoes.</p>

<p>"What's your name?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"What do you want to know that for?"</p>

<p>"Curiosity," was the cool response. "I'd like to chalk
it up in my memory as belonging to a young chap who
couldn't even be civil to the fellow who saved him from
drowning."</p>

<p>A tinge of color ran through the youth's pale face.</p>

<p>"The captain of the ferryboat would have saved me, if
you hadn't," said he.</p>

<p>"He couldn't have got there in time. You were about
to sink as I grabbed you."</p>

<p>There was a silence, broken at last by the youth.</p>

<p>"My name's Thompson," said he, "and I live in Sausalito."</p>

<p>"You got on the boat at Tiburon?"</p>

<p>Thompson was recovering his normal condition by
swift degrees. He flashed a strange look of suspicion
at Matt.</p>

<p>"Well, yes," he answered. "I've been staying there
for a while; but I live in Sausalito. Give me a cigarette."</p>

<p>"You've come to the wrong shop for cigarettes, Thompson.
I'm beginning to understand why you couldn't keep
yourself afloat in the water better than you did&mdash;too
many paper pipes. They play hob with a fellow's endurance."</p>

<p>The <i>Sprite</i>, by that time, was abreast of the docks,
and off the unsavory quarter known as the "Barbary
Coast."</p>

<p>Thompson paid little attention to Matt's remarks, but
fixed his eyes gloomily on the shipping as they glided past.</p>

<p>There was something at the bottom of Thompson's
mind, and Matt wondered what it could be.</p>

<p>"I suppose," Thompson continued, tiring of looking at
the ships and the sweating stevedores, "that it's a lucky
thing for me you happened to be around to pick me up."</p>

<p>"You might call it that," returned Matt dryly.</p>

<p>He had his back to his passenger, so that he might
pick a berth for the <i>Sprite</i> somewhere in the vicinity of
the foot of Clay Street. When he spoke he did not look
around.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm obliged to you," proceeded Thompson. "I
guess you needn't take me to Sausalito, after all. I'll
get out and go to a hotel. There's a lot of hotels on
the 'Front.'"</p>

<p>"Stay away from the hotels on the 'Front,' Thompson;
that's my advice to you. They're not the right sort of
place for a fellow like you to stop, even for a short time."</p>

<p>"I guess I can take care of myself," was the haughty
rejoinder.</p>

<p>"I guess you think you can, Thompson. You seem to
have a pretty large opinion of yourself."</p>

<p>"Are you trying to insult me?"</p>

<p>"Great spark plugs, no! Why should I want to do
that?"</p>

<p>"I don't like the way you talk, that's all. You act as
though you didn't believe what I said."</p>

<p>"That's where your imagination is working overtime.
What is it to me, one way or the other, whether you're
telling the truth or not?"</p>

<p>Matt saw the berth he was looking for, and turned the
<i>Sprite</i> into the slip. Two minutes later he was alongside
the dock, and had his painter fastened to a post. As he
faced about, after making the painter secure, he saw that
Thompson had gained the dock, and was starting off toward
the street, his feet sluicing around in his wet shoes,
and his trousers slapping about his legs as he walked.</p>

<p>He was intending to leave without any further talk
with Matt, and the latter leaned against a post and
watched him with half-humorous, half-wondering eyes.</p>

<p>Before he reached the street, however, McGlory and
Ping Pong dodged around the end of a loaded dray and
came face to face with him.</p>

<p>McGlory stopped short, and stared. So did Thompson.
Then McGlory jumped forward with a whoop,
countered the half-hearted blow Thompson aimed at him,
and grabbed him around the waist.</p>

<p>"Sufferin' Joseph!" cried McGlory, "if it ain't Cousin
George! Speak to me about that, will you? Cousin
George Lorry, that I've been bushwhackin' all over
'Frisco to find! Easy, George! You couldn't get away
from me in a thousand years, and you know it.
Whoop-ee, Matt! Come this way, and come a-running!"</p>

<p class="chaptitle">AN ODD TANGLE.</p>


<p>In a flash Motor Matt recalled what McGlory had told
him among the sand dunes beyond the Presidio barracks.
He had described a fellow, about his own heft and height,
whom he named as George Lorry. Could it be that
Matt had picked up the very chap McGlory was looking
for? And McGlory had referred to him as his cousin!</p>

<p>Matt hurried forward to where the so-called Thompson
was struggling to get away from the cowboy.</p>

<p>"Hands off of me, McGlory!" panted the bedraggled
youth. "You haven't any right to lay a finger on me,
and you know it!"</p>

<p>"I haven't, eh?" growled McGlory. "Well, you just
try to bolt, and I'll give you a run for your alley. You're
a pretty specimen, ain't you? Oh, shucks! I'm plumb
disgusted with you, and so's everybody else. What do
you suppose the folks think, back in Madison?"</p>

<p>There was an exasperated rattle in the other's throat,
but words and strength failed him, all at once, and he
drooped limply in McGlory's arms.</p>

<p>"He's played out, Joe," said Matt. "Let him sit down
for a minute and rest."</p>

<p>"What a mess he's made of this business," muttered
McGlory angrily, as he allowed the flabby form he was
holding to slip down on the rough cobblestones. "He
hasn't as much sense as the law allows, and you can
spread your blankets and go to sleep on that."</p>

<p>"You're positive he's the fellow you were looking for,
Joe?" inquired Matt.</p>

<p>"Positive? Why, pard, I know him as well as I know
my own picture in the looking-glass. See that scar?" and
he indicated a thin red line over his cousin's right eyebrow.
"I don't need even that to prove who he is," McGlory
added.</p>

<p>"He told me his name was Thompson, and that he
lived in Sausalito."</p>

<p>"He's liable to talk anything but straight&mdash;<i>now</i>. Let's
get him somewhere to a hotel. Sufferin' sand hills! his
folks would throw a fit if they could see him like this.
His name's George Lorry, and he lives in Madison, Wisconsin.
What's more, he's a cousin of mine, although
that's nothing to congratulate myself about." McGlory
bent down. "Able to walk, George?"</p>

<p>"Yes," was the sullen rejoinder.</p>

<p>"Any particular place you'd like to be taken?"</p>

<p>"Bixler House, around in Kearney Street. Get a cab."</p>

<p>"Got any money, George?"</p>

<p>Lorry's hands went slowly into his pockets.</p>

<p>"All I had with me is in the bottom of the bay," he
answered sulkily.</p>

<p>"I don't think I can dig up enough to pay for a cab,
but I reckon it's just as well for us to ride."</p>

<p>"I'll foot the bill," chimed in Matt. "Here, Ping!"</p>

<p>Ping was almost as hard a sight as was Lorry, but he
came blandly forward in his bare feet.</p>

<p>"Yasso, Missul Matt," said he.</p>

<p>"Go and get a cab for us, Ping."</p>

<p>"Allee light. My workee fo' you," and he darted
away along the street.</p>

<p>"I thought there was something queer about Lorry,"
remarked Matt.</p>

<p>"It's queerer than you think. Matt," replied McGlory.
"The whole yarn, when you go over it from end to end
and crossways, is enough to make a feller's hair stand
like the fur on a buffalo robe."</p>

<p>Lorry looked up with a scowl.</p>

<p>"How did you know where I was?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Didn't you buy a ticket to San Francisco?"</p>

<p>"I bought a ticket to Chicago."</p>

<p>"And from there, George, you bought one for here.
Think you could fool the wise boys your father had
scramblin' around Chicago lookin' you up? I got a telegram
at Tucson asking me to hustle for 'Frisco, and do
what I could to locate you. I've been in this burg for a
week, and had just about made up my mind you'd taken
a boat for somewhere on t'other side of the Pacific. And
to think you were riding from Tiburon on the same craft
that was carrying me!"</p>

<p>"I saw you on the boat, and I jumped overboard to get
away from you."</p>

<p>McGlory went up into the air and came down with an
astounded look at Matt.</p>

<p>"Say something about that!" he gasped. "Sufferin'
Hottentots, Matt, did you hear him? He jumped overboard
to get away from his cousin, Joe McGlory! Don't
tell me, George!" he growled to Lorry. "You're not
such a fool as that comes to. We're out of the same
family, mind, and I'd hate to think it."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you don't know everything," faltered Lorry.</p>

<p>"Keno, I don't; but I'm goin' to know everything,
George Lorry, before we part company."</p>

<p>All this, of course, was more or less Greek to Motor
Matt. It was clear enough that George Lorry had come
of good stock, and equally clear that he had been pampered
and spoiled. As for the rest of it, Matt was completely
in the dark.</p>

<p>Just at that moment the cab arrived. As it drew up,
Ping Pong threw open the door and jumped out.</p>

<p>"My gottee, Missul Matt!" he chirruped. "My workee
fo' you, huh?"</p>

<p>"For a while, yes, Ping," Matt answered, unable just
then to think of any other satisfactory method for dealing
with the Chinaman. "Stay here and watch the boat
till I come back. Savvy?"</p>

<p>"Can do," crowed Ping Pong, "you bettee. My workee
fo' Motol Matt. Hoop-a-la!"</p>

<p>The Chinese boy seemed as delighted as he had been
over in Tiburon, when ticket number 73 won the boat.
He had insisted on working for Matt, and the pleasant
feeling that comes with a job brought a grin to his face
and satisfaction to his soul.</p>

<p>Matt, McGlory, and Lorry loaded themselves into the
cab, and were driven away in the direction of Kearney
Street.</p>

<p>"Let's get right down to cases, George," said the cowboy
when they were well on their way. "First off, just
understand that I'm your friend, that I'm representin' the
folks back in Madison, and that I haven't trailed you to
get back those ten thousand plunks."</p>

<p>With an effort, Lorry braced back in his seat and
pushed the straggling hair out of his eyes.</p>

<p>"I didn't know what you were after, McGlory," he
answered; "but I wasn't going to be bagged by <i>you</i>.
When I'm ready to go home I'm ready, and not before."</p>

<p>"Oh, you ain't?" grunted the cowboy sarcastically.</p>

<p>"That's flat. The folks haven't treated me right, and
they know it. They&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, cut that out," growled McGlory wearily. "Haven't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
you got any sense, or are you just half fake and half
false alarm? The trouble with Uncle Dan and Aunt
Mollie is that they've done a heap too much for you. If
you'd had to knock about the mines and cattle ranges,
same as me, earnin' your grub by hard knocks, I reckon
you'd see things a lot different."</p>

<p>"I know my own business," snapped Lorry. "You
haven't been in Madison for a year, Joe McGlory, and
you don't know how the old man has been rubbing my
fur the wrong way. I told him I wouldn't stand for it&mdash;and
I didn't."</p>

<p>"You're a pill!" snorted McGlory, in a temper.</p>

<p>"What's more," pursued Lorry, in a temper that
matched his cousin's, "I'm not going to take any insolence
from you. You're nothing but a rowdy, anyhow. Your
father was a rowdy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>McGlory leaned over and dropped a hard hand on
Lorry's knee.</p>

<p>"That'll do you, my buck," said he, his low voice ringing
like steel. "While my father was alive he had my respect,
and I did what he told me to. What's more, he
steered me plumb right. He didn't have the money your
father had, but that wasn't his fault. As for the rest,
just remember that my mother was your mother's sister.
Whenever I go to that hill, just out of Tucson, where
those two mounds are heaped up, side by side, I can stand
between 'em and say, with a clear conscience, that I'm
livin' square. In my place, George Lorry, you couldn't
do that, and you know it."</p>

<p>McGlory's eyes flashed, and, on the instant, the liking
Matt had already conceived for the cowboy intensified
into a fast and enduring friendship. Joe McGlory had
character, and the right kind of an outlook upon life.</p>

<p>At that moment the cab came to a halt.</p>

<p>"Here's the place," announced McGlory, pushing open
the door, "and a fine old honkatonk it is. I've been to
this place huntin' for you. Wonder why I didn't find
you?"</p>

<p>"Probably," was the sarcastic comment of Lorry, "you
didn't ask for Thompson."</p>

<p>Matt paid the driver of the cab, and then followed McGlory
and his cousin into the dilapidated building. A
frowsy-looking clerk bestirred himself and leaned over
the counter, his curious gaze centring on Lorry.</p>

<p>"Gee Christopher!" he exclaimed, "is that you, Mr.
Thompson?"</p>

<p>"Give me the key to my room," snarled Lorry.</p>

<p>The key was handed over, and Lorry led the way out
of the room and up a flight of narrow stairs. A hall
was traversed, and near the end of it Lorry unlocked a
door, and bolted across the threshold. McGlory rushed
after him, and when Matt stepped into the bare little
room, the cowboy was jerking a revolver out of his
cousin's hand. The drawer of a bureau, at one side of
the room, was open.</p>

<p>"Now what do you think!" cried McGlory, whirling
away and pushing the revolver into his pocket. "He
yanked this pepper box out of that drawer, Matt, and
turned it on himself. With all his highfalutin' airs, that
cousin o' mine hasn't got the backbone of a jellyfish.
Look at him! Did you ever see any one of his age and
size with less manliness in his make-up?"</p>

<p>Matt turned and looked at Lorry. The next moment
Lorry stumbled to the bed and fell on it at full length,
burying his face in the pillow.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE RICH MAN'S SON.</p>


<p>"Blubbering!" muttered McGlory, with a look of profound
disgust. "I might overlook his attempt to shake
a cartridge into himself, but this baby act is too much
for me."</p>

<p>George Lorry was a puzzle to Motor Matt. And all
Matt had overheard between McGlory and Lorry had
only made the puzzle more perplexing.</p>

<p>"Don't be too hard on him, Joe," said Matt. "There
must be something pretty serious at the bottom of this
or Lorry wouldn't have tried to shoot himself."</p>

<p>"<i>Did</i> he try," asked McGlory darkly, "or was it only
a bluff?"</p>

<p>"According to his story, he jumped off the ferryboat
to get away from you. That alone proves he was desperate."</p>

<p>"Maybe he was talking with two tongues when he said
that."</p>

<p>Matt stepped over to the side of the room.</p>

<p>"Why did he leave Madison, Joe?" he asked in a low
voice, as soon as McGlory had joined him.</p>

<p>"He got to be more than Uncle Dan could handle.
You see, pard, Uncle Dan's money runs up into seven figures,
and George corralled the notion that whenever he
wanted anything all he had to do was to order it sent up
to the house. He joined a yacht club, and wanted to
put a motor boat in a race, so what does he do but order
a five-thousand-dollar racer, and drew on dad. Dad
lands on the proposition with both feet, and little George
over there is so mad he sulks in his room for a week,
then he chases himself out of the house, and trots a heat
with a swift bunch of thoroughbreds, who spend their
time gamblin' and drinkin'. George does that, you know,
just to show how mad he is; but dad's dander is up
good and plenty, and he vows he'll send George to a military
academy, where they'll straighten the kinks out of
him or else break him in two. George was more worked
up over the military school than he was over the racing
boat, so he opens dad's safe one night, takes out ten
thousand in cold cash, and slips away from Madison between
two days.</p>

<p>"Uncle Dan is a pretty good sort of fellow, although
he never did anything for the McGlorys&mdash;not so you
could notice it. He writes me all this that I've been tellin'
you, Matt, and says that, if I see anything of George,
will I please rope down, and tie him, and wire. The
day after I get the letter, along comes a telegram saying
George went to Chicago and bought a ticket for 'Frisco,
and asking me to hit only the high places between Tucson
and the Golden Gate. I went, and I've been here a week,
walkin' my boot soles off, and askin' questions till I was
blue in the face&mdash;but nothing doing. I got the notion that
George had used his ten thousand for a trip to furrin
parts, and so I was just beginning to cut loose on my own
account and enjoy the boats when you and I came together,
and this business of the <i>Sprite</i> was pushed into
the grooves. If it hadn't been for you and the <i>Sprite</i>,
pard, I'd never have found George. Now that I have
found him, what am I going to do with him? Speak to
me about that. I'd like to unload a little of the responsibility
onto you."</p>

<p>"He's spoiled," observed Matt, after a little reflection;
"and that's a cinch."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, no, he ain't spoiled!" scoffed McGlory. "He's
just mildewed with conceit and cobwebbed with ideas of
his own importance. Back of all that, he's got about as
much s-a-n-d as a gopher. He's over there now leaking
great big briny tears like a Piute squaw who's been
caught stealin' a string of glass beads. Wonder if he
thinks he can melt <i>me</i>?"</p>

<p>McGlory's black eyes glittered as they wandered to the
heaving form on the bed.</p>

<p>"You'd think he was seven instead of seventeen," he
grunted.</p>

<p>"There may be something in him, Joe," suggested
Matt, "for all that."</p>

<p>"There ain't anything in him worth while&mdash;you
couldn't find it with a mikerscope."</p>

<p>"Let's give him a chance, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Chance? I'm willing. But what's the number? And
how you going to play it?"</p>

<p>"Your first move is to get hold of that ten thousand.
He doesn't seem to have it with him, and it may be that
he's feeling cut up because he gambled with the money,
and lost it. If you can't get the money, then find out
where it is. Don't go at him hammer and tongs, but use
a little tact."</p>

<p>McGlory grinned.</p>

<p>"Smooth him down with a piece of velvet, eh?" he
queried. "Dust him off with a few sweet words, and
gently lift him back on the pedestal where he's already
stood for more years than have been good for him. Not
me, pard. Anyhow, I'm short on tact. You do it."</p>

<p>Matt laughed a little as he looked at the cowboy and
listened to him. It was plain that Matt's sympathy for
George wasn't appreciated, and that if any diplomacy was
used it was Matt who would have to use it.</p>

<p>Without further words Matt walked over to the bed
and pulled up a chair.</p>

<p>"George," said he, "we're friends of yours, and we
want to help you. Everybody makes a mistake now and
then, and you've made a big one, but there's no use fretting
about it. That ten thousand is the principal thing.
If we can get hold of that, you'll be able to work out of
this thing in good shape, and perhaps we can fix it so
you can return to Madison and cut a better figure there
than when you left the town."</p>

<p>"I don't want to go back to Madison," came the muffled
reply from the pillow. "The governor has treated
me like a dog, and I've washed my hands of him."</p>

<p>"Suppose we could arrange matters so the governor
would treat you better?"</p>

<p>"You can't," snuffled George; "nobody can. The governor's
a brute."</p>

<p>"I think we can make your father see things in a different
light," went on Matt; "but the first thing to do is
to send back that money."</p>

<p>George jammed his head deeper into the pillow.</p>

<p>"I haven't got it," he whispered.</p>

<p>"You must have done a lot of gambling to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't. It was stolen from me. The red-whiskered
man with a mole on his face took it."</p>

<p>"How was that? Turn over here, George, so we can
hear you."</p>

<p>"That's all there is to it," declared George, lifting his
face a little so his words were more distinct. "I met him,
and Kinky, and Ross on the train. I thought they were
nice, sociable fellows; but that's where I made a mistake.
They got on the train at Salt Lake City, and when we
reached 'Frisco they got me to come to this hotel. The
red-whiskered man had business over in Tiburon&mdash;I don't
know what it was&mdash;and he went over there the next day
after we reached 'Frisco, and lost his trunk check. They
wouldn't let him have the trunk without the check, and
he was awfully worked up. Kinky told Red-whiskers
that maybe I had swiped the check, and they all seemed
to believe it. Anyhow, Red-whiskers said the trunk was
worth more'n ten thousand and they made me turn over
that money I'd brought from home. Red-whiskers said
that when I found the check, or when he proved his
property and made the railroad company give up his
trunk, he'd give me back the money. I went over to
Tiburon, the next day, myself, and when I got back
here, Kinky, Ross, and the other fellow had left. I've
been going over to Tiburon every day since, but I
couldn't find the check or hear anything about it. And
I haven't heard anything about Red-whiskers, either.
He and his two pals have stolen the money, that's what
they've done. I was an easy mark, and&mdash;and&mdash;what's
the good of living, anyhow?"</p>

<p>George jammed his head down into the pillow again.</p>

<p>This strange recital left Matt and McGlory gasping.
It was clear that George had fallen into the hands of
sharpers, and had been robbed, but there was that baggage
check Matt had picked up near the little Tiburon
wharf. That looked as though there might be something
in the yarn Red-whiskers had told about losing the
check.</p>

<p>"Well, speak to me about this!" breathed McGlory.
"That check you found, pard, may be the very one this
chap with the auburn wind teasers lost! Wouldn't that
knock you slabsided? Sufferin' jew's-harps! Why, I
never heard anythin' to match it. Fate is workin' you
into this game for fair."</p>

<p>Lorry hoisted himself up suddenly on the bed.</p>

<p>"Did you find a trunk check over in Tiburon?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Matt, and took the flat piece of brass
from his pocket.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" exclaimed Lorry. "It would be a big load
off my mind if that check could be used for getting back
the money. Light the gas, McGlory."</p>

<p>It was falling dark outside, and the cowboy scratched
a match and touched the flame to a jet. As soon as the
light was going, Lorry took the check in his own hands
and looked it over exultantly. Then, abruptly, he
jumped for the bed and rushed toward a suit case that
lay on a chair.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do, George?" inquired
McGlory.</p>

<p>"Get into some dry clothes and then hunt for Red-whiskers.
This means a whole lot to me. I'm going
to Honolulu, and I need that ten thousand."</p>

<p>"Don't be in a rush, Lorry," said Matt. "Was there
just ten thousand in the roll? Didn't you use any of
it?"</p>

<p>"Not a cent! I had enough to get me to 'Frisco, and
pay a few other expenses, aside from that. And it wasn't
a roll; it was a packet with a band around the middle
stamped with the name of the Merchants' and Traders'
Bank, of Madison. Jupiter, but this is a good clue,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Some one rapped on the door. McGlory answered
the summons and found the frowsy-looking clerk and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
boy of about nine in the hall. The clerk pushed the boy
forward and pointed to Motor Matt.</p>

<p>"That's him," said the clerk, "an' I'll bet money."</p>

<p>"You Motor Matt?" queried the boy, rushing into the
room.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Matt.</p>

<p>"Den dis here's fer you. Dere's an answer, an' I'll
wait fer it."</p>

<p>The boy handed over an envelope. Matt opened the
envelope and read the inclosure. A strange light leaped
into his gray eyes.</p>

<p>"Who gave you this, my lad?" he asked of the boy.</p>

<p>"Dunno de cove, but he had red lilocks an' a face like
er ape."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not giving him anything till he proves his
property, see? You tell him that. Also tell him that I
won't meet him in Turk Bremer's Place, but will be at
the foot of Clay Street in half an hour. Understand?"</p>

<p>"Sure thing," grinned the boy.</p>

<p>Matt snapped a quarter into the air and the boy
grabbed it and made off.</p>

<p>"What's it all about, pard?" asked McGlory.</p>

<p>"Did you tell anybody in Tiburon about my finding
that trunk check, Joe?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"I told the galoot that bossed the raffle."</p>

<p>"Then that explains it," muttered Matt. "Listen."</p>

<p>Thereupon he read the note aloud.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'<span class="smcap">Motor Matt</span>: Several days ago I lost a baggage
check somewhere in Tiburon, and a couple of hours ago
I was told that you had found one there. It's a cinch
it's mine. Give it to the boy; or, if my bare word that
it belongs to me isn't enough, then come to Turk
Bremer's Place on the "Front" in half an hour and I'll
prove property.</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">John Smith.</span>'"<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>McGlory fell back in his chair. Lorry, with a startled
exclamation, grabbed the note out of Matt's hand to look
at it for himself.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A PLAN THAT FAILED.</p>


<p>Motor Matt was as profoundly surprised at the way
matters were falling out as were McGlory and Lorry.
As McGlory had said, fate seemed to have selected Matt
for the particular work of recovering Lorry's money.</p>

<p>"This is luck!" whispered Lorry. "If you can get
back that money for me, Motor Matt, I'll give you five
dollars."</p>

<p>"Don't strain yourself, George," grinned McGlory.</p>

<p>"I will," declared Lorry. "But you've got to get it
back to-night. There's a boat for the Sandwich Islands
to-morrow, and that's the one I was planning to take."</p>

<p>"You're not going to emigrate, George," asserted
McGlory. "We need you right here in the United States
for a spell yet."</p>

<p>Matt gave the cowboy a swift and expressive look.</p>

<p>"I think, Joe," said he, "that Lorry has been dictated
to too much. Leave him alone and let him make his
plans."</p>

<p>McGlory stared incredulously.</p>

<p>"That's the talk," expanded Lorry, puffing up like an
angry tomtit. "I'd been bossed altogether more than
was right or necessary. From this on I'm my own
master. You've got a little sense, Motor Matt. I give
you credit for that, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Thanks," answered Matt, with an irony so slight
Lorry let it get past him. "Will you stay right here in
this hotel while Joe and I are getting the money for
you?"</p>

<p>"Sure, I will! But I want it to-night."</p>

<p>"We'll get it as quick as we can. Red-whiskers,
otherwise John Smith, may not have it about him, so it
may be some time before we can lay hands on it."</p>

<p>Lorry's face fell at this.</p>

<p>"You'll get it, though, won't you? You've got to get
it. Do that for me and I'll give you five dollars apiece."</p>

<p>"Fine!" rumbled McGlory, with a wink at Matt. "If
George's generosity ever strikes in it'll bother him worse
than the measles. How did Red-whiskers know we were
here, pard?"</p>

<p>"Probably he traced us through the <i>Sprite</i>," answered
Matt. "He found the launch at the foot of Clay Street,
and Ping must have heard us tell the cab driver to drive
us to the Bixler House. Ping, of course, told the fellow."</p>

<p>"And he sent the boy with a note, knowing it wasn't
healthy to come himself!" crowed McGlory, slapping his
hands. "The old rooster didn't know how we had
tangled up with George&mdash;Ping didn't tell him that."</p>

<p>"We haven't much time to work our plan, Joe," said
Matt, starting for the door. "You'll stay right here
Lorry, until you hear from us?"</p>

<p>"Of course," answered Lorry. "All I want is that
money. Get it so I can sail for Honolulu to-morrow."</p>

<p>"We'll do the best we can," replied Matt, as he and
McGlory left the room and the hotel.</p>

<p>"You've got me guessing good and plenty, pard," said
the cowboy, while he and Matt hurried toward the water
front and the foot of Clay Street. "It wouldn't be right
to let George pull out for furrin parts."</p>

<p>"Of course not!" answered Matt.</p>

<p>"But you told him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That he had been dictated to too much. You see,
Joe, I wanted to reassure him, as much as I could, so
he'd be sure and stay at the hotel. After we recover the
money we can do with that cousin of yours whatever we
think best."</p>

<p>"That's you! Shucks! Now, I reckon, you understand
how much tact I've got. But George&mdash;say, ain't
he the limit? But he'll not be absent a whole lot at the
wind-up, I can promise you that. I'm in this to help
Uncle Dan and Aunt Mollie, and you can bet your moccasins
that what George wants or don't want won't cut
much of a figure in the final scramble. But, tell me:
Do things always come your way, like this? As this
business opens up more and more, the strangeness of it
makes my skin get up and walk over me with cold feet."</p>

<p>"Well," laughed Matt, "just so you don't get 'cold
feet' yourself."</p>

<p>McGlory chuckled.</p>

<p>"I come from a country," said he, "where it's too hot
for chilblains. But what's the plan?"</p>

<p>"We'll get a policeman," answered Matt, "and have
him keep in the background while we're talking with
Red-whiskers. As soon as we're sure he's the man we
want, we'll signal for the officer to come forward and
take him in tow."</p>

<p>"Keno! We'll let the law juggle with Red-whiskers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
But wouldn't it have been better to let the law get in its
work at Turk Bremer's? There'd be plenty of light
there so we could see what's doing."</p>

<p>"Those dives on the 'Front' are dangerous places, Joe,
and it's well for us to leave them alone. As it is, we'd
better walk in the middle of the road when we get to
Clay Street."</p>

<p>"Surely, surely. I reckon your head's as level as they
make 'em. How am I for a pard, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"A One," said Matt heartily.</p>

<p>"Shake!" cried McGlory, and they stopped to seal
their friendship with a cordial grip.</p>

<p>When close to the "Front" they encountered a policeman
and told him as much as necessary in order to get
him to lend a helping hand.</p>

<p>"If we're going to make an arrest," demurred the officer,
"we ought to have a warrant."</p>

<p>"There's no time for that, officer," said Matt.</p>

<p>"Well, let me see that note this chap you call Red-whiskers
sent by the boy."</p>

<p>Matt passed it over, and the policemen withdrew into
the glare of a street lamp to read it.</p>

<p>"This here is pretty good evidence that you're handin'
me a straight story," said the officer, returning the note,
"but I'm a gopher if I'd help you on such a showing if
it wasn't that you're Motor Matt. Your picture was in
the papers"&mdash;here he gave Matt a swift sizing&mdash;"and
there's no doubt but you're the fellow. Heave ahead,
and don't pay any attention to me. When I'm needed
just yell 'Come on!' and I'll be in the game before you
can say scat."</p>

<p>Matt and McGlory continued on, taking the middle of
the street until they reached the "Front." Here, as they
passed along the docks with their masses of shipping,
they kept a sharp watch for the man they were seeking.
For some distance they followed the docks without success,
passing the dozing form of Ping Pong curled up
at the foot of the post to which the <i>Sprite</i> was moored.
Ping did not see them, and they did not let him know
they were passing.</p>

<p>"The Chink stacks up pretty well for a heathen,"
commented McGlory; "and he's bound to go on your
pay roll, Matt, whether you want him or not. If he was
any&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hist!" warned Matt, his quick eye observing a dark
figure emerging from the shadows on the right.</p>

<p>The form came close and halted in front of the two
boys, not far from a flickering light. It was the form of
a tall man, in a slouch hat and dark, respectable clothes.
He had a beaklike nose and red whiskers, but it was
too dark for the boys to see the mole mentioned by
Lorry. However, there was no doubt about his being
the man.</p>

<p>"Motor Matt?" inquired the stranger briefly.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Matt.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm the man that wants the trunk check. The
railroad people won't let me have the trunk unless I pass
over that brass tag. Mighty accommodatin' set, I must
say."</p>

<p>"Is your name John Smith?"</p>

<p>"Didn't I put that to the note?" demanded the other.
"What's that got to do with it, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"Not much, but I'd like to have you tell me where
Ross and Kinky are, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The fellow muttered an oath and jumped back. His
hand, at the same instant, darted toward his hip pocket.</p>

<p>Matt had mentioned "Ross" and "Kinky" merely to
make assurance doubly sure. The man's actions proved
that he was one of the three thieves, and that he had
come prepared for anything that might develop to his
disadvantage.</p>

<p>McGlory, watching Red-whiskers like a hawk, jumped
for him and grabbed the hand that was reaching for his
hip. Matt likewise jumped forward.</p>

<p>"Come on!" he cried to the officer.</p>

<p>A tramp of running feet was heard&mdash;but the sounds
came from two directions, from behind the red-whiskered
man and also back of Matt and McGlory.</p>

<p>Another moment and Matt saw two figures leaping
out of the heavy shadow. One of them came on toward
the place where the boys were struggling with Red-whiskers
and the other turned aside and set upon the
policeman. Matt heard a scuffle, a sound of angry
voices, and then a <i>thump</i> as of a savage blow.</p>

<p>Before he could draw a full breath, a heavy fist had
struck him in the shoulder and thrown him reeling backward.</p>

<p>"It's a fall!" panted a husky voice. "Cut for it, on the
double quick. The launch&mdash;it's the only thing for us."</p>

<p>Three figures leaped away along the docks. They
were the three men, Red-whiskers, Kinky, and Ross&mdash;for,
in Matt's mind, it was clear that the two latter had
been in hiding, waiting to help their pal if he needed it.</p>

<p>The suggestion about the launch aroused Matt's fears
for the <i>Sprite</i>. He started toward the place where the
launch was moored, but halted when he saw the three
men vanishing in another direction.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A CHASE ACROSS THE BAY.</p>


<p>The suddenness with which the red-whiskered man's
accomplices had interfered with Motor Matt's plan, and
caused it to fail, was as startling as it was unexpected.
Matt, standing back toward the edge of the dock with a
thumping pain in his shoulder, felt a spasm of chagrin
and disappointment.</p>

<p>McGlory picked himself up, assisted the policeman to
his feet, and both came toward Matt. The policeman
was rubbing his head, and seemed dazed.</p>

<p>"Sufferin' snakes!" exclaimed McGlory. "I'm trying
to figure out what happened. Who were the other two
that blew in on us, pard, just as we had everything our
own way?"</p>

<p>"They must have been Kinky and Ross," replied Matt.</p>

<p>"Who are they?" demanded the officer.</p>

<p>"Two pals of this red-whiskered man. He probably
had them waiting in the background, just as we had you
waiting to help us, officer."</p>

<p>"This ain't the last of this!" cried the officer hotly.
"Which way did they go?"</p>

<p>Matt indicated the direction. The officer started off
at a run, tugging at his pocket.</p>

<p>"Why don't you come along?" he demanded over his
shoulder.</p>

<p>"One of them said something about getting away in a
launch," returned Matt. "I didn't know but it was a
boat that I have here, and I think it's well to stand
around and see if they come back."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll see where the scoundrels go, anyhow," said the
officer, and vanished at a rapid pace.</p>

<p>"Are you hurt, Joe?" inquired Matt.</p>

<p>"My feelin's are badly injured," answered the cowboy.
"The rap I got on the block don't count for much,
although it was enough to drop me, right where I stood.
They're a fine lot, those galoots. I reckon, it's a cinch
that they're the chaps we want&mdash;and the ones we won't
get. George will weep some more when he hears about
it."</p>

<p>"Listen!" said Matt.</p>

<p>The exhaust of an engine struck on his ears, faintly
but distinctly. It came from somewhere to the south of
the place where he and McGlory were standing.</p>

<p>"What is it, pard?" queried the cowboy.</p>

<p>"A boat! Didn't you hear Red-whiskers speak about
a launch?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I reckoned it was the <i>Sprite</i> he meant, and
that he changed his mind when he saw you hustling to
get between him and the boat."</p>

<p>"It wasn't the <i>Sprite</i>, but another launch, and&mdash;&mdash; Ah,
see that!"</p>

<p>Matt pointed into the darkness to the southward. A
light could be seen moving around the end of a slip,
gliding across the dark water like a star.</p>

<p>"There they go!" cried McGlory excitedly.</p>

<p>"This way, Joe," called Matt, whirling and running
toward the <i>Sprite</i>. "Hurry!"</p>

<p>The Chinese boy was still dozing by the post, the
noise caused by the recent scrimmage not having been
sufficiently loud to disturb him. He was on his feet,
however, the instant Matt dropped a hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>"You Motor Matt?" palpitated Ping. "You wantee&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cast off the rope, Ping," cut in Matt, sliding from
the edge of the dock into the boat. "Quick! Get
in behind, Joe," he added to McGlory. "We haven't an
instant to lose."</p>

<p>"Well, hardly," answered the cowboy, scrambling
aboard while Matt started the engine. "Time's plenty
scarce for us if we're to overhaul that other boat."</p>

<p>The painter fell into the boat and Ping fell along
with it.</p>

<p>"I didn't intend to take you, Ping," said Matt, switching
the power into the propeller and turning the nose
of the <i>Sprite</i> toward the open bay.</p>

<p>"By Klismus," said Ping, with unexpected firmness,
"my workee fo' you! Where you makee go, my makee
go, allee same. Me plenty fine China boy."</p>

<p>"Got any sand, Ping?" asked McGlory.</p>

<p>"Have got. Fightee allee same like Sam Hill.
Whoosh! Plenty big high China boy, allee same Boxer.
You watchee, Motol Matt watchee. My workee heap
fine fo' Motol Matt. Workee, fightee&mdash;him allee same."</p>

<p>While this brief cross-fire was going on between
McGlory and Ping, Matt was driving the <i>Sprite</i> down
the slip for all she was worth. The water slithered up
along her sharp bow and flung itself in spray over the
crouching forms of the cowboy and the Chinese. The
launch, because of the weight aft, was very much down
by the stern; but this, by throwing the bow high, helped
the boat to slip over the water.</p>

<p>After dropping from the dock into the launch Matt
had not seen the moving light until, when he was halfway
out of the slip, the little gleam danced across the
open space between the outer ends of the two piers.</p>

<p>"Great spark plugs!" muttered Matt, "that's the other
boat."</p>

<p>"She's going north!" exclaimed McGlory.</p>

<p>"Which makes it easy for us to pick up her trail and
follow. If she had gone south, she might have got
away from us."</p>

<p>"She's rippin' along like an express train," murmured
the cowboy, watching the light vanish around the end of
the pier.</p>

<p>"She's not speedy enough to leave the <i>Sprite</i> behind,"
exulted Matt, his nerves quivering in unison with the
little tremors the humming cylinders sent through the
boat.</p>

<p>"If those tinhorns see us, pard&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They won't. We're not carrying any lights, and I'm
surprised to see them with one."</p>

<p>"Mebby they can hear us if they can't see us."</p>

<p>"We'll have to drop behind far enough so they won't
hear us. Their own boat makes twice as much noise as
the <i>Sprite</i>, and that will drown the throb of our exhaust
and the whir of the cylinders."</p>

<p>Just then the <i>Sprite</i> dashed out of the black maw of
the slip, wheeled in a foamy arc and turned her nose
northward. There were many lights in the bay&mdash;red and
green side lamps and white masthead lights, and others,
but Matt was not confused. The white gleam straight
to northward was the one he knew he should follow.</p>

<p>A lightish streak surged in the wake of the other
launch. Matt could not make out much about the craft
except that she was considerably larger than the <i>Sprite</i>
and had a canvas or wooden canopy over the cockpit.</p>

<p>But the <i>Sprite</i> was the faster boat. Matt, studying
the distance that separated the <i>Sprite</i> from the launch
ahead, found it necessary to choke down the motor in
order to keep from overhauling the three thieves.</p>

<p>"I thought you wanted to catch them," complained
McGlory, conscious of the lessening speed.</p>

<p>"What good would it do for us to overhaul them out
in the bay?" queried Matt, humping over the wheel and
speaking without turning his head. "There are three of
the scoundrels, and they're armed and would probably
be only too glad to have us tackle them. If Red-whiskers
could lay me by the heels, you know, he'd get his
trunk check."</p>

<p>"Correct, pard. It wouldn't do to run alongside of
them in the bay. But what're you thinking of?"</p>

<p>"We're just shadowing them to find out where they
go. When we discover that, we'll hold a council and
decide what's to be done next."</p>

<p>"Waugh!" sputtered McGlory. "Queerest ever that
I can't ride on the water without getting a gone feeling
in the pit of my stomach."</p>

<p>"Have you got it now, Joe?"</p>

<p>"Awful. If I had any supper aboard, I reckon I'd
unload. And I can go through all kinds of rough
weather on a buckin' bronk! No matter how much a
bronk pitches, or bucks, it never makes me squeamish&mdash;but
boats! Well, the minute I get into one I begin to
have cramps. Funny, ain't it? They got a fake boat
in a picture gallery in Tucson, and if a galoot wants a
tin type of himself, at sea, he gets into the fake boat and
lets the camera snap. Honest to Mack, every time I go
to that place for a tin type I get seasick."</p>

<p>Matt laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>"And yet you like boats!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Achin' for 'em all the time. It's human nature to
be contrary with yourself, I&mdash;&mdash; Sufferin' centipedes!
I'm an Injun if that other boat isn't making for Tiburon."</p>

<p>"I don't think so, Joe," said Matt. "There's a place
around the point that's called Belvedere Cove. The
other boat is either going to put in there or else go
farther up the bay. We can tell in a minute."</p>

<p>A little later Matt announced that the other launch
had doubled the point and put into the Cove. For a
brief space the point of land hid the larger launch from
the eyes of those in the <i>Sprite</i>; but, as the <i>Sprite</i> pushed
around the point, a multitude of lights burst suddenly
on the gaze of her passengers&mdash;stationary lights they
were, with the exception of one that was gliding among
them like a shooting star.</p>

<p>"Tell me about that!" muttered McGlory, standing up
for a better look. "The surface of the cove looks like a
town. Where are all those lamps?"</p>

<p>"On houseboats, Joe," replied Matt. "The tide-water
inlets, in and about San Francisco Bay, are full of
house boats at this season of the year. That's the other
launch&mdash;that moving light, over there."</p>

<p>McGlory continued to stand up, bracing himself with
a hold on Ping's pigtail, which happened to be the most
convenient thing handy.</p>

<p>The <i>Sprite</i>, keeping to the trail of the moving white
gleam, darted in and out among the house boats. From
many of the anchored boats came sounds of mirth,
music, and gay talk. Some one, on an ungainly craft
which the <i>Sprite</i> passed within a short fathom, shouted a
warning for Matt to put out a light. This warning, of
course, could not be heeded, and the little launch foamed
onward out of earshot.</p>

<p>Suddenly Matt shut off the power and brought the
boat to a halt.</p>

<p>"The other launch has tied up alongside a house boat,
Joe," he announced, "and we're at the end of our trail.
What shall we do? Go to Tiburon after a policeman or
two or go on with the work ourselves?"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE LION'S MOUTH.</p>


<p>McGlory made a survey of the surface of the water
directly in front of the <i>Sprite</i>. A hundred feet away
was a large house boat, with the launch snugged up close
to its side. The house boat was of the ordinary two-deck
variety, the upper deck covered with an awning. A
short staff extended upward from the highest point of
the boat and supported the riding light. While the cowboy
was looking, a light flashed in the windows of the
house boat's cabin and then settled into a steady gleam.</p>

<p>"I'm not one of those ducks who wear a sixteen collar
and a number five hat, pard," observed McGlory, as
he dropped back on the thwart, "but, at the same time,
what you've thrown up to me takes more sense than I've
got to decide. If we leave here and chase over to
Tiburon after a few policemen, these birds we're after
may fly the coop while we're gone. Then, taking it
t'other way around, if we go ahead on our own hook
we may make another bobble like that we got tangled up
with at the foot of Clay Street. Those tinhorns are
heeled, and you can chalk that up good and big; so, if
us longhorns go prancing in there and begin pawing for
trouble, the result looks like a cinch&mdash;for Brick-whiskers
and the trunk check. You say what we're to do."</p>

<p>"I don't think we could accomplish much by coming
company-front with those fellows and demanding Lorry's
ten thousand dollars," said Matt. "As a matter of fact,
we don't know whether they have the money with them,
or whether they've spent it, or whether they've left it
somewhere ashore."</p>

<p>"They've got it in their clothes, Matt, I'll gamble on
that. When these tinhorns freeze to a roll of that size,
they keep it handy and quiet."</p>

<p>Matt flashed a look at the house boat.</p>

<p>"They seem to be the only ones aboard the house
boat," said he, "and they're evidently having a talk in the
cabin. I believe we'll run alongside the other launch
and then I'll leave you and Ping to watch the <i>Sprite</i>
while I do a little reconnoitring."</p>

<p>"Meaning," added McGlory, "to get right in among
'em, big as life, and run the risk of having them put
the kibosh on you?"</p>

<p>"It's not much risk, Joe, if I'm at all careful."</p>

<p>"Mebby not, but what's the good?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I can find out something of importance
about the money."</p>

<p>"You're putting your head in the lion's mouth. If the
mouth should happen to close&mdash;&mdash;" McGlory finished
with a shrug and a gurgle. "Speak to me about that!"</p>

<p>"If that should happen," said Matt, "I'll have you and
Ping to fall back on."</p>

<p>"Don't fall too hard, that's all."</p>

<p>Matt started up the motor again, proceeding slowly
and as noiselessly as he could. McGlory went forward
over the hood of the motor and prepared to make the
<i>Sprite's</i> painter fast to the larger launch.</p>

<p>The noise of the motor did not arouse any one in the
cabin&mdash;at least, no doors were opened and no one showed
himself on the house boat.</p>

<p>Shutting off the power as soon as the <i>Sprite</i> had gathered
headway enough to carry her to the other launch,
Matt lay over the wheel and watched while McGlory
leaned out and gripped the upright supporting the
canopy over the cockpit of the larger boat. Then, pulling
the <i>Sprite</i> along hand over hand, the cowboy came to
the bow and made the painter fast to an iron ring.</p>

<p>A mumble of voices could be heard coming from the
cabin of the house boat. When all was fast, McGlory
came back and got down off the hood.</p>

<p>"How'd it be if I went with you, Matt?" he whispered.</p>

<p>"A good deal worse, Joe, than for me to go it alone,"
was Matt's equally guarded reply. "One can crawl
around, and be more quiet about it, than two."</p>

<p>"Keno."</p>

<p>"Mebby so my makee go with Motol Matt," murmured
Ping, who, for the most part of that trip across
the bay, had been content to use his eyes and ears and
let his tongue rest.</p>

<p>Every move Matt made about the machinery had been
watched by the Chinese, and so intently that he had not
complained when McGlory used his queue for a support
while standing up in the boat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>"That <i>would</i> fix things," muttered the cowboy. "Why,
you little rat-eater, you'd get Matt into more trouble
than he could take care of. You'll stay right here with
me, and that shot goes as it lays."</p>

<p>"Awri," whispered Ping meekly.</p>

<p>Matt went forward on hands and knees. In getting up
to step from one boat to the other, the name of the larger
boat stood out clearly under the falling rays of the lamp.
She was the <i>San Bruno</i>. The young motorist made
mental note of the name, for it might be of value in catching
Red-whiskers and his pals in case the work of the night
proved useless.</p>

<p>Crossing the forward deck of the <i>San Bruno</i>, Matt
stepped easily to the passage that ran along the side of
the house boat's cabin. Then, on all fours, he crawled to
the window through which came the glow of light.</p>

<p>Rising up cautiously, he peered into the cabin. The
three men were there, seated on the cushioned benches
that ran along the sides of the little room. All were
smoking cigars, and the air was thick with the vapor.
The rascals had thrown off their hats and removed their
coats, so Matt had a good chance to study their evil faces.</p>

<p>Red-whiskers' mole was in plain evidence, but it could
hardly be called a disfigurement, as the face itself was
brutal and mercenary in every line.</p>

<p>The other two men were of like calibre, if their
features could be relied upon. They were talking, but it
was impossible for Matt to overhear what they were saying.
From their earnestness, however, it seemed plain
that an important topic was being discussed.</p>

<p>Presently, as Matt continued to look, Red-whiskers
bent down and pulled a satchel out from under the bench
on which he sat. The other two craned their necks
toward him as he took the satchel on his knees and
opened it.</p>

<p>Shoving one hand into the bag, the red-whiskered man
removed a thick packet of banknotes and held it up. The
packet was encircled by a paper band, and Matt's heart
thumped sharply against his ribs as he realized that this
was certainly the money stolen from Lorry.</p>

<p>While the red-whiskered man held the packet in his
hand, the other two talked to him. They appeared to be
pleading or arguing, Matt could not decide which.</p>

<p>Abruptly the money was dropped back into the bag
and the bag shoved under the bench once more, the red-whiskered
man shaking his head as he straightened up on
his seat.</p>

<p>"They wanted him to divide it, and he refused," was
the thought that ran through Matt's head.</p>

<p>This was followed by another idea, whose audacity
caused Matt to catch his breath.</p>

<p>Wouldn't it be possible to take the satchel out of the
cabin? If Matt could get the money, he would be perfectly
satisfied to let the thieves keep their liberty.</p>

<p>For the king of the motor boys and his two companions
to attempt to capture the three men would have been
foolish, and no doubt have ended in disaster; but to secure
the satchel by stealth, or through some ruse, seemed
feasible and worth trying.</p>

<p>Dropping to the deck again, Matt crawled to the end
of the house boat. At each end there was a wider strip
of deck than at the sides, so that the young motorist had
ample room to man&oelig;uvre without making any noise.</p>

<p>A door opened out of the end of the cabin upon the
rear deck, and beside the door was a flight of steep stairs
leading to the cabin roof.</p>

<p>There was nothing to be gained by going to the upper
deck, and to open the door and get inside the cabin promised
more danger than Matt deemed it wise to face. The
strip of deck on the starboard side of the cabin might
repay investigation, and Matt started around the corner.</p>

<p>But he did not turn the corner. He had no more than
reached a point where he could get a view of the starboard
alley than his startled eyes rested on a figure tilted
back in a chair against the cabin wall.</p>

<p>Well for motor Matt was it that the man was asleep.
Had he been awake, the lad would surely have been discovered,
and every hope of securing the satchel and its
contents would have gone glimmering.</p>

<p>Drawing back. Matt crouched on the deck and turned
the situation over in his mind.</p>

<p>What could he do to secure that satchel?</p>

<p>His plans, whatever they were to be, would have to be
laid quickly, for there was no telling how long the sleeping
man would remain asleep, nor how long it would be
before Red-whiskers, Kinky, and Ross finished their discussion
and came out of the cabin.</p>

<p>One move after another passed through Matt's mind,
only to be rejected and cast aside.</p>

<p>There was a window in the starboard wall directly
back of the place where the red-whiskered man was sitting.
In seeking to gain the starboard alley, Matt had
had that window prominently in mind. But what he
could do when he reached that window had not yet occurred
to him. Any move on that part of the deck was
out of the question, so long as the man occupied the chair.</p>

<p>The king of the motor boys, usually so resourceful in
expedients, could think of nothing, at that moment, that
pointed the way to possible success in the matter of the
satchel. The only ruse that suggested itself was to have
McGlory and Ping start some sort of a row that would
draw the three men out of the cabin, thus affording Matt
a chance to run in through a door, or climb in at a window,
and secure the grip. But this plan had many disadvantages&mdash;for
what would it avail Matt, or Lorry, if
he was to secure the satchel and then be left on the house
boat with it, at the mercy of the red-whiskered man and
his two pals?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>A talk with McGlory was advisable, in the circumstances,
and Matt began crawling across the after deck of
the house boat toward the <i>San Bruno</i>.</p>

<p>Before he had covered half the distance that separated
him from the edge of the house boat's deck his knee
rested heavily on some hard object attached to the
boards. It proved to be an iron ring, made fast in a
hatch cover.</p>

<p>Instantly the young motorist's plans underwent a
change. He would not leave the house boat just yet,
but would open the hatch, drop below and explore the
lower part of the boat. If there was another hatch
leading up under the part of the cabin where the three
men were holding their secret session, then fortune
might point a way for something worth while.</p>

<p>The hatch cover was hinged. Softly Matt lifted the
trap and threw it back; then, letting himself down into
the scowlike hulk, he lifted the hatch again and cautiously
lowered it.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE MOUTH CLOSES.</p>


<p>When the hatch was closed, and Matt had shut himself
into the hull of the boat, he found that he was in
cramped quarters.</p>

<p>The air was stifling, and the smell of bilge water
was extremely unpleasant. He could not sit up without
knocking his head against the deck beams, and he
was entangled in a scattered pile of firewood. But if
he got where he wanted to go he must contrive to move
forward.</p>

<p>Taking a match from his pocket, he struck it on his
trousers, and looked about him in the feeble gleam.</p>

<p>The firewood was not all he had to contend with.
In addition to that, the hold was half full of boxes and
casks.</p>

<p>Making mental note of a course that would take him
forward with least trouble from the fuel and food supplies,
he pinched out the match and crawled carefully.</p>

<p>He realized, presently, that the voices from the cabin
were coming to his ears in increased volume; in fact,
he was hearing them much more distinctly than when
he had been at the window outside the cabin. Their
distinctness became much more apparent the farther he
advanced; not only that, but they served to help him
locate himself. When the voices were directly over his
head he paused.</p>

<p>The floor boards of the deck had spread slightly, and
the cracks were lined with threads of lamplight. This
explained the distinctness with which the voices reached
his ears. Sitting up, he stifled his breathing while he
listened.</p>

<p>"You fellers might just as well understand this from
the start off&mdash;that money stays together, all in a wad,
until we get safe out o' 'Frisco. Then there'll be a
divvy, and not before."</p>

<p>Red-whiskers was the speaker. Matt had no difficulty
in recognizing his raucous voice.</p>

<p>"Is that square, John?" demanded one of the others.
"Ain't Ross an' me entitled to our share, here an' now,
if we want it?"</p>

<p>"You're entitled to your share, Kinky, and you're
going to get it, but not until we're out of the woods.
I'd have whacked up to-night, but for that raw deal we
had worked on us at the foot of Clay Street. This
Motor Matt, it's as plain as a pikestaff, is trying to help
Lorry. Lorry himself wouldn't have the nerve to play
a game like that. Why, he stole the money himself, see,
and he ain't goin' to ask the law to step in and help him
get the stuff back. But this Motor Matt&mdash;well, from
all I can read about him, he's all nerve and is given to
meddling. We've got to quit this house boat and sail
on that Jap steamer to-morrow. I'll pay our passage
to Honolulu out of the funds, and when we get to where
we're going we'll go snucks, share and share alike."</p>

<p>"I want mine now," struck in a third voice.</p>

<p>"That's you, Ross," growled Red-whiskers. "You
want to do some gamblin' and drinkin', which is the
worst things you could possibly do, not only for yourself,
but for Kinky and me. I'll not have it that way. When
we get in a safe place, we'll split the loot into three
parts, and you can take what's coming to you and go to
ballyhack, if you want to. But you can't tune up around
'Frisco while I'm in the town."</p>

<p>"What's to be done with the <i>San Bruno</i>?" asked a
voice which Matt identified as belonging to Kinky.</p>

<p>"We'll use her to take us to 'Frisco, in the morning,
just before the steamer leaves. Then we can turn her
over to her owner, pay him what's coming, and hustle
for the dock where we load ourselves for the Sandwich
Islands. I'm calculating we'll be safe enough there."</p>

<p>"O' course," spoke up the voice of Ross, "all I want's
to do the right thing by everybody an' have the right
thing done by me. I ain't putting up no holler, an'
don't think that for a minute; but I'm just about
strapped. I haven't got more'n two bits in my jeans."</p>

<p>"Well, you'll have three thousand of your own before
you're a week older, Ross, and I'd advise you to do the
same as I intend to do&mdash;invest it in a pineapple plantation
in the islands."</p>

<p>"Oh, splash! I'm going to invest my money in a
distillery," and Ross finished with a reckless laugh, only
he used a harsher expletive.</p>

<p>"It wouldn't be like you if you didn't," grunted Red-whiskers.</p>

<p>"Speaking along this line," spoke up Kinky, "reminds
me that I'm dryer'n the desert of Sahary. Suppose
we open a bottle?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>"That hits me," agreed Ross promptly.</p>

<p>"I'll go you&mdash;for just one bottle," came from the red-whiskered
leader of the trio.</p>

<p>Ross chuckled.</p>

<p>"John likes his nip jest as well as anybody," said he.</p>

<p>"What of it?" demanded the leader. "If I've got the
sense to take no more than is good for me, what's the
odds? The trouble with you, Ross, is that you never
stop until you make a fool of yourself. Let me tell you
something: Whisky is the worst enemy a man ever had.
It'll give him a little 'Dutch courage' for a piece of
crooked work, I grant you, but if a crook hangs onto
the drink it will ruin him in the end. That's right."</p>

<p>This was refreshing doctrine to come from such a
man as Red-whiskers. Matt listened to his talk with
a half smile.</p>

<p>"Get the stuff, Kinky," said the impatient Ross.</p>

<p>There was a sound of moving feet across the floor.
The next moment a match was lifted directly over
Matt's head and a flood of lamplight revealed him to
Kinky. The scoundrel flung back with a wild yell.</p>

<p>Matt waited for no more. With a pounding heart he
scrambled over boxes and casks and stove wood on his
way toward the other hatch.</p>

<p>A confused babel of voices reached him from the
cabin; feet could be heard running over the floor, and
some one raised a great clatter dropping into the hold.</p>

<p>"Come out here!" shouted a fierce voice. "Come out,
I say, or I'll shoot!"</p>

<p>Matt was willing to run the risk of stopping a bullet,
there in the darkness, and he was in altogether too big
a hurry to throw up a barricade between him and the
man with the gun.</p>

<p>Rising on his knees, he lifted his hands to the hatch.
No shot was heard, and Matt reflected that the scoundrels
would not dare fire a revolver for fear of attracting
attention from the other house boats in the cove.</p>

<p>To throw back the hatch took only an instant, but, as
the young motorist scrambled through the opening, he
was seized by the shoulders and hurled roughly to the
deck.</p>

<p>He was up again almost as soon as he was down.</p>

<p>"Landers!" bellowed a gruff voice; "where the deuce
is Landers? Take him, Kinky. I guess the two of us
are enough without Landers. I'll head him off on this
side."</p>

<p>Matt felt a pair of arms go around him from behind.
With a fierce effort, however, he twisted clear of the
clutching hands, whirled and struck out with his fist.</p>

<p>An exclamation, more forcible than polite, was jolted
out of Kinky.</p>

<p>"Hang it!" the scoundrel added, "he's got a fist like
a pile driver. Lay for him, Ross! I'm wabbling."</p>

<p>Before Motor Matt could turn and defend himself
against Ross, Red-whiskers bolted through the open
cabin door.</p>

<p>"Don't make so much noise, you fellows!" he called
angrily. "Every house boat in the cove will be&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then he saw Matt. The latter had sprung to the
edge of the deck with the plain intention of diving
overboard.</p>

<p>Before he could carry out his plan Ross and the leader
of the three men had him by each arm and had jerked
him roughly back.</p>

<p>Matt struggled with all his power, but there were
three against him, and he was thrown to the deck and
dragged into the cabin, one of the men holding a hand
over his mouth to prevent outcry.</p>

<p>The cabin was divided into two rooms, and Matt was
half dragged and half carried through the darkness of
the first room into the glaring lamplight of the one
beyond.</p>

<p>"Put him in that chair over there," ordered the red-whiskered
man. "You needn't be afraid he'll yell,
Kinky," he added, with savage menace, "so take your
hands from his mouth. If he lets out a whoop, or tries
to bolt, I'll fire, even if the noise brings a tender from
every house boat in the bay."</p>

<p>One look into the gleaming eyes of Red-whiskers
was enough to warn Matt that discretion demanded
passive compliance with the wishes of his captors.</p>

<p>Kinky removed his hands from Matt's lips, and Ross
released his arms. Both men stepped to one side, glaring
at him curiously and vindictively.</p>

<p>Red-whiskers, a revolver lying on his knees, was sitting
on the cushioned bench, directly facing Matt. With
a steady hand he was lighting a fresh cigar.</p>

<p>"Pull the window shades, Kinky," said he calmly.
"Ross, lock both doors and put the keys in your pocket.
We'll have a little heart-to-heart talk with Motor Matt,
and I don't want Landers to see what we do, or hear
what we're talking about."</p>

<p>Motor Matt, blaming himself for what had happened,
sat quietly and wondered what was to come.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">SURPRISING EVENTS.</p>


<p>"You're a daring youngster," remarked Red-whiskers,
leering at the prisoner through the smoke of his cigar.
"I suppose you think you're pretty smart, eh? Well,
there are others. How did you find out we were here?"</p>

<p>"I found out," said Matt. "I don't think it would
help me any if I told you how."</p>

<p>"Don't get gay," admonished Red-whiskers, his eyes
dropping significantly to the weapon on his knee. "Remember
where you are, Motor Matt. You're interfering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
with a game that doesn't concern you in the least. Poor
policy, boy, poor policy. You ought to have sense
enough to know that without being told. Where did
you meet young Lorry?"</p>

<p>"I'm not talking about Lorry or any one else," returned
Matt. "You might as well let me go."</p>

<p>"All in due time, my lad, and after you satisfy our
curiosity. You rowed over from Tiburon?"</p>

<p>Matt was silent.</p>

<p>"That's what he must have done," spoke up Ross.
"How could he have got here if he hadn't rowed over?
He didn't swim, that's sure, for he's got on all his clothes
an' they're dry as a bone. I'll go out and see if I can
discover his boat."</p>

<p>Ross turned to the door, but Red-whiskers lifted a
restraining hand.</p>

<p>"We'll look after the boat in due time, Ross," said he.
"Just now we'll give all our attention to Motor Matt.
I'll trouble you for that trunk check, my lad," he finished,
facing the prisoner once more.</p>

<p>Matt, knowing it would be worse than useless to resist,
drew the check from his pocket and tossed it to
Red-whiskers.</p>

<p>"Much obliged," said the leader grimly, examining
the tag. "This is the one, sure enough," he added
to Kinky and Ross.</p>

<p>"How did you know I had it?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"The gent that raffled off that boat put me next.
How much pleasanter it would have been," Red-whiskers
pursued, slipping the check into his pocket, "if you'd been
nice and sociable, over there at the foot of Clay Street,
and let me have that brass tag without trying to make
trouble. What have you gained, Motor Matt, by roughing
things up like you did? And what have you gained
by sneaking in here? Are you any better off?"</p>

<p>"Cut it out, John," growled Kinky. "What's the good
o' readin' him a lecture?"</p>

<p>Red-whiskers scowled at Kinky.</p>

<p>"Be so good as to dry up," he requested. "You never
was able to see anything an inch or two beyond your
nose, so you can't guess what I'm driving at. Motor
Matt," he went on, to the prisoner, "what did you lug
that cop along with you for, when you came to the foot
of Clay Street? What was your object? Was you afraid
of that part o' town, and was he just a sort of bodyguard?"</p>

<p>Matt laughed at that.</p>

<p>"Hardly that," said he. "You've got ten thousand
dollars that belongs to young Lorry, and the policeman
was there to get it."</p>

<p>"Well, well!" exclaimed the red-whiskered man, with
a humorous glance at Ross and Kinky, "he thinks we've
got ten thousand dollars! But," he continued, "assuming
that we <i>have</i> got that much money, how do you
figure that it belongs to Lorry? Did Lorry steal it from
his old man? If he did, does that make it his? If it
does, Motor Matt, then if we stole the money from
young Lorry it ought to belong to us."</p>

<p>"That's foolish," said Matt, trying to guess what Red-whiskers
was driving at.</p>

<p>"Possibly it is. Now, you're a pretty good sort of fellow,
only a trifle headstrong, and I don't mind saying
that we <i>did</i> take that ten thousand from young Lorry.
And why? Let me tell you it was all perfectly legitimate."
He leaned over confidentially and tapped Matt
on the knee with the muzzle of the revolver. "We're
detectives, Motor Matt, Chicago detectives, and old Mr.
Lorry, that lives in Madison, Wisconsin, commissioned us
to recover that money. We've recovered it; and you"&mdash;Red-whiskers
leaned back and laughed softly&mdash;"thought
we was thieves and tried to have us pinched! What do
you think of that for a joke?"</p>

<p>"Then," said Matt, "it's all a joke about you and
your pals sailing for Honolulu to-morrow and dividing
the money between you when you get there?"</p>

<p>Enjoyment immediately faded out of the situation for
the red-whiskered man. He straightened up, pulled at
his fiery beard and glared at Motor Matt.</p>

<p>Matt realized that he had made a mistake. By speaking
as he had done, he had virtually admitted that he
knew more about the plans of the three rascals than they
had thought possible.</p>

<p>"Ah," and a crafty smile crossed Red-whiskers' face
"I thought you'd let out something, if I prodded you a
little, but I'll be hanged if I expected that. This is beginning
to look mighty serious for you, Motor Matt.
Where did you learn all that?"</p>

<p>"I was under the floor," replied Matt.</p>

<p>"Exactly&mdash;under the floor listening to a conversation
that didn't concern you. Because of that, you're going
to stay two weeks on this boat, and Landers is going to
keep you. By then we'll be where we're going and out
of harm's way, and it won't be possible for what you
know to have any effect. You've only yourself to blame
for this. Who's that chink that won the boat in the
raffle?"</p>

<p>"I don't know much about him," replied Matt.</p>

<p>"You took his boat across the bay for him, didn't
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, he knew where you had gone, because he told
me. That's how I was able to send that note to the Bixler
House. The chink said you had a couple of fellows
with you&mdash;one, in particular, who had fallen off a ferryboat
and whom you had picked up. Was that young
Lorry?"</p>

<p>"I'm not saying a word," said Matt, "about Lorry.
You say you're going to keep me on this house boat for
two weeks. If that's your plan, all right, go ahead with
it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>For several minutes Matt, from where he sat, had been
trying to locate the satchel under the bench. It was impossible
for him to see it, and he supposed that it had
either been moved by Red-whiskers, or taken away.</p>

<p>"We're going to leave for parts unknown," continued
the leader of the three rogues, "and we're going to take
young Lorry with us. I guess if we give him a thousand
of his father's money he'll be satisfied."</p>

<p>"You're a scoundrel, on your own showing," cried
Matt angrily, "but I don't think you'd be such a contemptible
scoundrel as to take that boy away and make
him a thief, like you and your pals!"</p>

<p>"Softly, Motor Matt," warned Red-whiskers. "What
is the boy now but a thief, and on his own showing, at
that? I don't think we can hurt him any, and by taking
him away we'll be doing a good thing for him&mdash;and
for us."</p>

<p>"You'll ruin him, that's what you'll do," proceeded
Matt indignantly. "Haven't you a thought for his people,
back there in Wisconsin?"</p>

<p>"What are his people to us? I had intended all along
to compromise with the cub and give him a thousand,
but you got to him before we did. He doesn't dare appeal
to the law&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There are others who will act for him," broke in
Matt. "There's the making of a man in young Lorry,
and if you do as you say you intend to, you will end by
making him no better than you are."</p>

<p>"You're not very complimentary, it strikes me," said
Red-whiskers easily, bending down and groping under
the bench with one hand. "We might just as well take
our boodle and get away from here. I had planned to
stay on the house boat all night, and run over to 'Frisco
in the launch in time to catch that steamer to-morrow,
but you've compelled us to change our plans. We'll
take a night train, and&mdash;&mdash; Where in blazes is that
satchel?"</p>

<p>Failing to find the satchel with one hand, Red-whiskers
had used both hands. Even then the treasure
grip eluded him, and in a sudden flurry he dropped to
the floor on his knees and looked under the bench. The
next instant he had leaped up, maddened and furious.</p>

<p>"It's gone!" he shouted.</p>

<p>Kinky and Ross jumped as though they had been
touched by a live wire.</p>

<p>"Gone?" they echoed blankly.</p>

<p>"You know something about this!" cried Red-whiskers,
facing Ross furiously.</p>

<p>"What're you givin' us?" retorted Ross menacingly.
"If you think you can throw any such bluff as that,
John, and make it stick, you've got another guess coming.
You've taken the satchel yourself! You never intended
to whack up with Kinky and me, and this is a
move to corral all the money."</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool!" snapped Red-whiskers, studying
Ross' face for a moment, and then swerving his eyes to
Kinky.</p>

<p>The affair had a dark look, for a space, as both Kinky
and Ross had reached their hands under their coats. If
the three scoundrels had a quarrel among themselves,
Matt felt that he would have a chance of escape. His
eager eyes traveled to the doors, and then to the window.</p>

<p>"Look here, you two," went on Red-whiskers, his eyes
glittering fiendishly, "the satchel's gone. I'll take back
what I said about you two having had anything to do
with trying to lift it. Certainly I didn't&mdash;you ought to
know that. We've all been in this room&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Except when we ran aft to ketch that fellow," fumed
Ross, indicating Matt with a jerk of the head. "You
was in here alone with the satchel then, John. How do
we know you didn't hide it on us?"</p>

<p>"Mebby it was him!" stormed Kinky, stepping toward
Matt.</p>

<p>"How could it have been him?" objected Ross. "He
was under the floor, and we kept him busy every minute
until he bobbed up through the after hatch."</p>

<p>"Then it was Landers!" cried Kinky. "I never did
like that feller's looks. I'll bet it was Landers! If&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Just at that moment the <i>chug-chug</i> of a motor was
heard outside.</p>

<p>"He's turning over the engine!" cried Red-whiskers,
jumping for one of the doors. "Landers has got the
satchel and he's getting away with it in the boat."</p>

<p>Red-whiskers threw himself against the door, trying
to break it down.</p>

<p>"Wait, confound it!" yelped Ross; "here's the key,
John. I'll unlock the door if you'll gi' me a chance."</p>

<p>The three men paid no attention whatever to Matt. As
soon as Ross could unlock and throw open the door they
all rushed out.</p>

<p>The <i>San Bruno</i> was still lying where she had been
moored, but the wheeze of a boat could be heard, and a
craft, a cable's length away, could be seen vanishing
wraithlike into the shadows across the cove.</p>

<p>"Landers has got another boat, somewhere, and he's
running away in it!" declared Kinky.</p>

<p>"We'll overhaul him with the <i>San Bruno</i>," cried Red-whiskers,
throwing himself into the launch. "One of
you stay behind and look after the prisoner&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hang the prisoner!" answered Kinky. "The money
means more to us than he does."</p>

<p>Ross cast off the rope that held the launch alongside
the house boat, and both he and Kinky sprang aboard
the <i>San Bruno</i>.</p>

<p>Matt, bewildered by the surprising events that had
followed each other so swiftly, stood on the forward
deck of the houseboat and watched while the <i>San Bruno</i>
got under way and started on the track of the other boat.</p>

<p>That other boat, of course, Matt knew to be the <i>Sprite</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
But why was she tearing off across the cove like that?
Why were McGlory and Ping leaving Matt when they
must have known he was in difficulties? Had they
started for Tiburon to get a few policemen and bring
them back to help their comrade out of his trouble?</p>

<p>As these questions sped through Matt's bewildered
mind a laugh echoed behind him&mdash;and he turned to face
the most surprising of all the events that had happened
that night.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">M'GLORY'S RUN OF LUCK.</p>


<p>Joe McGlory, judging from the way fortune had
turned her back on him during his whole life, was positive
that he had not been born "under a lucky star." It
was more likely, he thought, that he had been born under
the Dipper, and that the Dipper was upside down at the
time. Yet, be that as it might, luck had never had
much to do with McGlory. Whatever he got came to
him always by hard knocks and persistent grubbing.
But there was a bright lining to the cloud, and this lining
was making ready to show itself.</p>

<p>He sat impatiently on the stern thwarts of the <i>Sprite</i>,
while Matt was doing his reconnoitring on the house
boat, waiting impatiently for him to return and report.
Ping was forward at the steering wheel of the launch,
feeling casually and with a certain amount of awe of
every lever that manipulated the motor and the gear.</p>

<p>The little <i>Sprite</i> was completely dwarfed by the larger
boat alongside of which she cuddled, like a young duck
under the lee of its mother, and the gloom of the higher
bulwarks overshadowed McGlory and Ping.</p>

<p>From time to time, the cowboy stood up and looked
across the cockpit of the <i>San Bruno</i> toward the house
boat. He saw Matt's head silhouetted in the light from
the cabin window, and finally he saw him move away and
vanish from sight behind the raised forward deck of the
larger motor boat.</p>

<p>After that, McGlory champed the bit, and waited.
As is usual in such cases, the seconds dragged like minutes,
and the minutes were like hours. The cowboy
finally made up his mind that something had gone wrong,
and that he ought to investigate.</p>

<p>This feeling grew upon him until he could stand it no
longer. Creeping forward to where Ping was caressing
the steering wheel, he paused beside him for a moment.</p>

<p>"Motor Matt's been gone so long, Ping," said he, in a
low tone, "that I'm afraid he has struck on a snag. If
that's so, it's up to me to flock over to the house boat and
do my little best to get him out of trouble. Savvy?"</p>

<p>"Heap savvy," replied Ping. "By Klismus, China boy
go 'long. Mebbyso you makee fall in tlouble, China boy
savee you, savee Matt, savee evelbody. Huh?"</p>

<p>"Never you mind about Matt and me, Ping," returned
McGlory. "You stay right here&mdash;and stop fooling with
that machinery, too. First thing you know you'll have
the <i>Sprite</i> turning a summerset, and that would be about
the worst thing that could happen to us. Stay right here,
mind, and wait until you hear from Matt or me before
you budge."</p>

<p>"Awri'," said Ping meekly.</p>

<p>McGlory crawled over the hood, got aboard the <i>San
Bruno</i>, and then stepped softly to the deck of the house
boat.</p>

<p>A quick look around revealed the fact that Motor
Matt was not in evidence. Slipping forward along the
port alley, the cowboy took a hasty look through the
lighted window. The three men were smoking, and in
close converse, but McGlory was more interested in locating
Motor Matt, just then, than in anything else.</p>

<p>Instead of returning toward the after end of the house
boat, he passed on to the patch of deck at the forward
end&mdash;and was thus out of the whirl of excitement that
was turned on at the rear of the craft.</p>

<p>The yell given by Kinky when he lifted the trap in
the floor of the cabin and caught a glimpse of Matt
reached McGlory's ears almost as soon as he had gained
the wider deck at the end of the boat. Almost immediately
he heard the scramble inside the cabin, and then
the rush of feet aft.</p>

<p>He hesitated for a few seconds, not knowing what to
do. Matt had got into trouble, all right, but had he
gotten out of it?</p>

<p>Stepping quickly to a door which led directly into the
lighted front room of the cabin, McGlory softly turned
the knob and pushed the door open. The room was
empty. A trap in the floor was open, and also a door
leading into a dark room beyond. From somewhere
farther aft came angry voices and more sounds of
scuffling.</p>

<p>"That means me, I reckon," thought the cowboy,
rushing across the lighted room and into the darker
chamber farther on. It was his intention to keep going
and find out just what the struggle he had been hearing
might mean, and to do what he could for Motor Matt;
but he heard a sound behind him, just as he gained the
darkness of the rear room, which caused him to halt, turn
cautiously, and peer backward.</p>

<p>A tall, gangle-legged individual, with a mustache the
color of dried buffalo grass, a nose like a wart and eyes
that looked like a couple of wilted cactus blossoms, had
entered the door which McGlory had left open.</p>

<p>The manner of this person aroused the cowboy's interest
and curiosity. If he was one of the gang, what was
he doing there? And why was he acting in such a
stealthy manner, as though in a hurry and fearing to be
apprehended?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>McGlory, for a moment, curbed his desire to hurry on
to the rear of the house boat and stood and watched the
stranger from the safe screen of darkness.</p>

<p>The man was looking for something, that was plain.
Dropping to his knees, he reached under a bench at one
side of the room. What he wanted wasn't there. He
turned to the bench on the other side and gave an exultant
grunt as he pulled a satchel from under it.</p>

<p>After flashing a wary look around him, he opened the
satchel with trembling fingers and drew forth a package
of banknotes that made McGlory stagger.</p>

<p>Money! George Lorry's money!</p>

<p>That is what the cowboy thought on the instant. With
another jubilant grunt, the stranger snapped the satchel
shut and faded through the front door. McGlory was
about two seconds making up his mind, and then faded
after him.</p>

<p>The man was out of sight when the cowboy reached
the deck at the forward end of the boat. Heavy feet
were coming through the dark room of the cabin, and
McGlory knew it was hardly safe for him to stand in
the exposed position where he had placed himself.</p>

<p>Wondering where the man had gone with the satchel
and the money, he stepped around the corner of the cabin
into the starboard passage&mdash;and saw the man just dodging
around the opposite corner, on the after deck.</p>

<p>"That's where I nail him!" thought McGlory, moving
softly and swiftly along the alley.</p>

<p>As he passed the lighted window on that side of the
cabin a curtain was jerked down, and a door was
slammed. Following this, a key grated in a lock. Then
another door was slammed and another key grated.</p>

<p>The cowboy hesitated, trying to guess whether all that
had anything to do with the man who was making off
with the satchel. Unable to reach any conclusion, and
convinced that his duty lay in following the man, McGlory
moved noiselessly onward.</p>

<p>The light on the upright staff of the houseboat cast a
faint glow on the after deck, and here McGlory saw the
man he was following again on his knees and examining
the packet of bills.</p>

<p>In two jumps the cowboy was on the man's back.</p>

<p>"Steady!" he hissed in the man's ear.</p>

<p>The fellow began to struggle; and then, in a flash,
the cowboy remembered the revolver he had snatched
out of his cousin's hand and slipped into his pocket. In
a twinkling he had the weapon out of the pocket&mdash;and
commanded the situation.</p>

<p>"Don't shoot!" whined the man. "Great guns, I ain't
done anythin' to <i>you</i>."</p>

<p>"Put that bunch of green goods back into the grip,"
ordered McGlory.</p>

<p>"Thar she goes," said the man, letting the packet fall
into the satchel.</p>

<p>"Now give the grip a shove," continued McGlory, "so
it'll be closer to where I'm standing. That's the idea,"
he added, as the bag came sliding toward him. "Now,
pardner, I've got the money and you've got the experience,
and things are looking real fine. Who are you,
anyhow?"</p>

<p>"Landers," said the man. "I'm in charge o' this boat
for Big John."</p>

<p>"Big John, eh? I wonder if that's my friend, Mr.
Smith, otherwise Red-whiskers?"</p>

<p>"That's him," answered Landers, "but you ain't no
friend o' his, I'll gamble."</p>

<p>"Ain't I?" queried McGlory humorously.</p>

<p>"You're a detective, an' you've come here to bag Big
John an' them other coves. But you don't need to bag
me. I was only gettin' the money to turn it over to the
police."</p>

<p>"Oh, speak to me about that!" chuckled McGlory.</p>

<p>"Look out behind ye!" whispered Landers hoarsely.
"Big John is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>McGlory turned. As he did so, Landers fell off the
house boat and into the cockpit of the <i>San Bruno</i>.</p>

<p>"Ain't I easy?" grumbled McGlory, marking a half
run across the deck in the direction of the launch. "No,"
he muttered, "I won't do that, either. I've got the ten
thousand plunks belongin' to Uncle Dan, and I guess
I'll freeze onto 'em. Matt needs me, I reckon. With
the grip in one hand and George's pepper box in the
other, I'll walk through the cabin and see what I can do
for this new pard of mine."</p>

<p>The rear door of the cabin was unlocked. McGlory
passed through it and groped his way in the dark to the
other door.</p>

<p>He had barely reached the door when another commotion
assailed his ears, accompanied by loud voices. The
voices were so loud, in fact, that the cowboy could hear
distinctly all that was said.</p>

<p>Big John had just discovered the loss of the satchel,
and a violent scene was threatening. Then came the
popping of the motor, and the rush to get out of the
cabin and pursue Landers.</p>

<p>McGlory, beginning to understand what had happened
and how the thieves had been fooled, leaned against the
wall of the cabin and sputtered with merriment.</p>

<p>"Speak to me about luck, will you?" he gasped. "This
is once, anyhow, that I've got the winning number. I
reckon it's because I'm hooked up with Motor Matt."</p>

<p>He tried the bulkhead door, but found it locked. With
a sudden thought, he returned to the other door, took
the key he found there from the lock and tried it in the
lock of the bulkhead door. It worked like a charm,
and McGlory, satchel in one hand and revolver in the
other, pushed into the lighted room.</p>

<p>At the very least, he was expecting to find Motor Matt
on the floor, tied hand and foot. McGlory's astonishment
was great, therefore, when he discovered that Matt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
was not in the room. A form stood just outside the door,
on the forward deck, vaguely outlined in the darkness.</p>

<p>It was Matt, there was no doubt about it. Thoughts
of the way events had shaped themselves to befool the
thieves rushed over the cowboy again, and once more
he dropped against the side of the cabin. He exploded
a laugh that brought Matt into the room at a double
quick, and held him, just inside the door, staring as
though at a ghost.</p>

<p>"McGlory!" muttered Matt, rubbing his eyes.</p>

<p>"Keno, correct&mdash;and more, much more. It's McGlory,
Matt, and McGlory's got the <i>dinero</i>. Come to me, put
your little hand in mine for a good shake, and let's felicitate.
This will be happy news for Cousin George!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">WAITING AND WORRYING.</p>


<p>"In the name of all that's good, Joe," cried Matt, as he
and the cowboy shook hands, "where did you come
from?"</p>

<p>"From the <i>Sprite</i>, pard," grinned McGlory. "But that
was some sort of a while ago. I've been on the house
boat for quite a spell."</p>

<p>"Where did you get that satchel?"</p>

<p>"It's got the bundle of money in it, Matt&mdash;Uncle
Dan's money <i>sabe</i>?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I know! I saw the red-whiskered man take
the money out of the satchel, then put it back again and
push the satchel under that bench. But how did <i>you</i> get
hold of it? That's what I want to know."</p>

<p>McGlory dropped the satchel and collapsed on the
bench.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's the best ever," he laughed. "Those old
hardshells were fooled at their own game. Queer about
that money of Uncle Dan's. It's been in a good deal of
a taking ever since it left Madison. George takes it
from Uncle Dan, Red-whiskers takes it from George,
Landers takes it from Red-whiskers, and now here's
me taking it from Landers."</p>

<p>"Landers?" queried Mitt. "Did he take the money?"</p>

<p>"Took it the length of the boat. By then I was close
enough to get hold of it myself. But you cut loose and
tell me what went crossways with you&mdash;I've been worried
a heap about that&mdash;and then I'll even up by tellin'
how I jumped into the game."</p>

<p>Matt made short work of his end of the explanation,
and McGlory consumed but little more time. While McGlory
was talking, Matt was not only listening but also
putting two and two together in his own mind.</p>

<p>The cowboy finished with another jubilant laugh, but
Matt suddenly became grave and got up from the bench.</p>

<p>"Let's go outside, Joe," said he, "where we can keep
an eye on our surroundings."</p>

<p>"What's there in our surroundings to worry us?
We've got the money, haven't we?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but the 'taking' you mentioned a few minutes ago
may keep up&mdash;unless we're on the alert. Suppose Big
John, Kinky, and Ross come back here in the <i>San Bruno</i>?
What would happen then? We haven't any <i>Sprite</i> to
take us off, remember."</p>

<p>"That's a fact," and McGlory went suddenly grave
himself. "What ever came over that chink to run off?
Say, I'll bet he got to tinkering with the motor, and
that it started on him and he couldn't stop it. Consarn
these chinks, anyhow!"</p>

<p>"Don't be too quick to blame Ping, Joe," remonstrated
Matt. "I don't think that's what happened."</p>

<p>"What then?"</p>

<p>"Landers thought you were a detective, didn't he?"</p>

<p>"That's what he said."</p>

<p>"Well, he was afraid of being arrested and jailed for
helping Big John and the other two. That's the reason
he played a trick and tumbled off the boat."</p>

<p>"Well? Go on, pard, and give me the rest of it."</p>

<p>"Don't you think it's likely that he climbed aboard
the <i>Sprite</i>, took her away from Ping, and then rushed
her across the cove to the nearest landing?"</p>

<p>"Oh, tell me!" muttered McGlory. "And I never, no,
I never once let that drift into my head! And yet, why
not? Wasn't it the natural thing for Landers to do?
Any day you can find in the almanac, pard, I'm shy
something when it comes to headwork. But here's the
point: Can Landers run the <i>Sprite</i> fast enough to keep
her away from the <i>San Bruno</i>? If he can't, I can see
what will happen to Ping and Landers when that outfit
of fire-eaters come up with them. Oh, shucks! This
ain't turnin' out so pleasant as I thought. Suppose we
hike for the deck and keep our eyes peeled. It may save
us something, although I'm a heathen if I see what we
could do if the <i>San Bruno</i> came back."</p>

<p>"If we have to," said Matt, "we'll take the money and
swim to the nearest house boat."</p>

<p>"It will be a damp roll of bills we take ashore with us
if we have to do that."</p>

<p>"Better a lot of wet money, Joe, than no money at
all."</p>

<p>"Right, exactly right, as per usual. I've got this pop-gun
of Cousin George's. It looks like one of those toy
Fourth of July things that make a noise and let it go at
that. Still, maybe the sight of the thing would scare
somebody."</p>

<p>Together they left the cabin, and, in order that their
view might be more extensive, climbed the steep stairs to
the house boat's upper deck. Here there were comfortable
chairs, and the boys sat down and allowed their eyes
to wander about them over the shadowy surface of the
cove.</p>

<p>The lights of the house-boat settlement were still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
gleaming in every direction, but every sound had died
away and a dead silence reigned.</p>

<p>"If a launch was coming," said McGlory, "we could
hear her a mile off&mdash;which is three times as far as we
could see her."</p>

<p>"That's right," said Matt, "and I'm hearing one now.
Listen! Unless I'm away off in my reckoning a boat is
bearing this way from the direction of Tiburon."</p>

<p>McGlory bent his head.</p>

<p>"You've made a bull's-eye, Matt," said he. "A boat's
coming, but is it the <i>Sprite</i> or the <i>San Bruno</i>?"</p>

<p>"It's the <i>San Bruno</i>," averred Matt.</p>

<p>"How do you make that out?" queried the wondering
cowboy.</p>

<p>"Why, a bigger volume of sound, distance considered,
than the <i>Sprite</i> makes. I noticed that particularly when
we were chasing the <i>San Bruno</i> across the bay."</p>

<p>"Well, you've got me beat, plumb. We've got to
swim, I reckon, going off one side of the house boat as
the launch ties up at the other?"</p>

<p>"We'll not take to the water until we have to, Joe.
Wait until we can get a good look at the boat."</p>

<p>Standing on the upper deck, the two boys faced in
the direction of the approaching launch, and waited and
worried.</p>

<p>Slowly, and after a period of time that seemed interminable,
a blot of shadow came gliding toward them
from among the clustered lights of the house boats.</p>

<p>Matt whirled to grip McGlory's arm.</p>

<p>"What's to pay now, pard?" asked the startled cowboy.</p>

<p>"Why," answered Matt, "two boats are coming!"</p>

<p>"Two?" echoed McGlory, squinting in the direction of
the moving blot. "I can't make out more than one, and
it's plenty hard to see that."</p>

<p>"One is chasing the other&mdash;I can tell by the sounds,
alone."</p>

<p>"Good ear&mdash;remarkable. Put a lot of bronks on a hard
trail and I can shut my eyes and tell you how many
there are, up to five, by listening. But a boat's a different
proposition. How do you know one is chasing the
other, though? That's what gets me."</p>

<p>"Because," answered Matt, "the boat ahead is the
<i>Sprite</i> and the one behind is the <i>San Bruno</i>!"</p>

<p>"Sufferin' whirligigs!" exclaimed McGlory. "How
far ahead is the <i>Sprite</i>?"</p>

<p>"We can tell in a minute. Both boats are close&mdash;and
the <i>San Bruno</i> has put out her light. Ah, look!"</p>

<p>Matt leaned over the rail and pointed. By that time
the boats could be easily distinguished. The <i>Sprite</i> was
pounding along in a distressing way that proved there
was something wrong with her sparking apparatus or
her fuel supply, but, in spite of that, she was doing
nobly.</p>

<p>"It can't be that Ping is doing the work on the
<i>Sprite</i>," muttered McGlory.</p>

<p>"It sounds as though it might be Ping," said Matt.</p>

<p>"But he can't run the boat! Didn't we see him try,
at the Tiburon landing?"</p>

<p>"He's been watching me, and I think he's learned what
to pull and push and turn in order to keep the boat moving.
A Chinaman is a good imitator, Joe. The <i>San
Bruno</i> is giving our launch a close race, and we'd better
go down and stand ready to leap aboard the moment
Ping stops for us."</p>

<p>Hurrying down the steps, the two boys placed themselves
at the edge of the house boat's after deck, ready to
jump the moment the <i>Sprite</i> came close enough.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">PING STARS HIMSELF.</p>


<p>Ping was not impatient, while waiting for Matt and
McGlory to come back from the house boat, and he was
not worrying. His callow mind was engaged with the
wheels and levers of the <i>Sprite's</i> machinery, and he
might be said to be enjoying himself, in his artless,
heathen way.</p>

<p>His first acquaintance with the <i>Sprite</i> had not been of
a pleasant nature, but Ping had overcome his awe and
fear, to a large extent, by watching how readily the boat
obeyed the touch of Motor Matt's hands.</p>

<p>The Chinese boy had observed all the details of starting,
steering, and stopping. Sitting alone in the launch,
he touched the various levers in proper order, again and
again&mdash;touched them lightly, for he had no desire to
make the boat turn a "summerset," as McGlory had
said she would do if he got too free with his attentions.</p>

<p>The uproar and commotion that started abruptly on the
house boat and continued at intervals for some time,
naturally drew the Chinaman's eyes across the <i>San
Bruno</i>. But the attraction of the motor was too much
for Ping to withstand, and he jumped at a conclusion
to assure himself that everything was well with Matt and
McGlory, and returned to his childlike interest in the
machinery.</p>

<p>Some one scrambled off the <i>San Bruno</i> into the <i>Sprite</i>.
The rough boarding of the little launch caused her to
sway and shiver and dance at the end of her painter.</p>

<p>"You makee plenty fuss, McGloly!" complained Ping,
grabbing at the sides of the boat to hold himself upright.</p>

<p>Before he could look around a rough hand had caught
his queue and jerked him over backward.</p>

<p>"Not a bloomin' word out o' you, chink!" hissed a
menacing voice in Ping's ear. "Ahead with ye, now,
and unloose the painter. If you don't hustle, I'll kick yer
inter next week. This is a hurry-up call, and don't you
fergit that!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>Ping didn't wait to argue the question. Rolling over
the top of the hood, he knelt in the bow and tore the
painter loose from the iron ring. The engine was
chugging by the time he had finished, and when the
<i>Sprite</i> started, under the impulsive hands of the strange
white man, she leaped away with a jolt that rolled Ping
back into the arms of the boat's captor.</p>

<p>With an oath, the man hurled Ping into the bottom of
the boat. He would as soon have tumbled the Chinese
boy into the water, and it was luck, rather than design,
that kept Ping out of the wet.</p>

<p>Crawling back on the stern thwarts, Ping leaned on
his elbows, blinking his little eyes and trying to guess
what had happened.</p>

<p>Behind, over the swiftly growing stretch of water, he
heard an uproar on the house boat, then the pant and
throb of another engine.</p>

<p>The strange white man looked around and swore.</p>

<p>"They're chasin' me, but they won't get me!" he muttered.
"If this boat can put me ashore ahead of 'em, I'll
save my bacon dry-shod; an' if it can't, by thunder, I'll
take to the water and swim!"</p>

<p>Ping heard this, and dwelt upon the words for some
time. The strange white man was running away from
the other devil-boat. What had the strange white man
done? Were Matt and McGlory on the other devil-boat
trying to catch him? Or was it the three bad 'Melican
men who were doing the chasing?</p>

<p>Ping couldn't figure it out. About all he realized was
that there was a race between the <i>Sprite</i> and the <i>San
Bruno</i>. Inasmuch as the <i>San Bruno</i> belonged to the
enemy, Ping hoped in his heart that the <i>Sprite</i> would
leave her behind.</p>

<p>They were making for the shore of the cove, but the
strange white man was handling the boat badly. He
didn't push or pull the way Motor Matt did, and the
imprisoned devil under the hood&mdash;the power that made
the propeller whirl&mdash;coughed and spluttered with rage
and pounded on the machinery with iron hammers.</p>

<p>It got on Ping's nerves, and he hoisted himself to a
sitting posture.</p>

<p>"By Klismus," he cried frantically, "you lettee Ping
lun engine! Him makee go chop-chop, keepee <i>Splite</i>
away flom othel boat!"</p>

<p>The strange white man looked around with a snarl.</p>

<p>"Shut up!" he roared, "or I'll toss ye into the drink,
so help me!"</p>

<p>Ping shut up. Lying back on the thwart he watched
the other boat draw nearer and nearer. The shore was
yet a good way off, and it was plain the <i>San Bruno</i>
would overhaul the <i>Sprite</i> before the land could be
reached. And how the good devil under the hood was
fighting to do better! How hard it was begging the
strange white man to treat it right, and let it work
easier and take the <i>Sprite</i> away from the other boat.</p>

<p>Ping gave a deep groan. Oh, if he was only at the
wheel, and the pull-things and the push-things!</p>

<p>He looked around for something to throw at the
strange white man. If a monkey wrench, or a hatchet,
had been convenient, then one Landers would probably
never have known what struck him.</p>

<p>But, fortunately for Landers&mdash;and for Ping, too&mdash;no
weapon was available, and the race went on. The shore
was near now, but the <i>San Bruno</i> was nearer.</p>

<p>Ping, straining his eyes through the dark, could see
the men on the <i>San Bruno</i>. There were three of them,
and their boat was less than three lengths away!</p>

<p>Suddenly the <i>Sprite</i> slewed around, crosswise of the
<i>San Bruno's</i> course. Ping started up with a frightened
yell, a splash echoing in his ears.</p>

<p>There was no one at the wheel or the levers! Ping's
almond eyes turned swiftly shoreward, and there they
saw a form in the water, swimming strongly toward the
land.</p>

<p>But Ping was not thinking of the strange white man,
but of the <i>Sprite</i>. Hurling himself forward across the
midship thwart, he seized the steering wheel and turned
the launch in a wide circle.</p>

<p>A shout went up from the <i>San Bruno</i>.</p>

<p>"Halt, Landers! You can't get away with that
money! Stop and drop alongside or we'll cut you down
to the water's edge!"</p>

<p>Ping, naturally, couldn't understand this. The voice
that had called out was not the voice of Motor Matt or
McGlory. Since they were not on the <i>San Bruno</i>,
then, of course, they must still be on the house boat.</p>

<p>The Chinese boy started back over the watery trail
which the <i>Sprite</i> had recently traversed under the guidance
of the white man. Carefully he doctored the motor,
pulling and pushing as he had seen Matt push and pull,
all the while breathing choice prayers in his native tongue
to placate the demon in the engine.</p>

<p>The devil must have been placated, at least a little, for
he did not clamor quite so loud, but at intervals he hammered
in a way that was very distressing to Ping. However,
Ping couldn't help it, so he settled himself down to
his steering, occasionally throwing a look over his shoulder
at the other boat.</p>

<p>The <i>Sprite</i> was gaining on her slowly. Ping continued
to breathe his heathen prayers, and to beg the
honorable demon to stop pounding in the machine and to
put its extra power into the little wheel under the boat.</p>

<p>As the <i>Sprite</i> came closer and closer to the house boat
Ping was able to see two figures on the upper deck.</p>

<p>Were they Motor Matt and McGlory? He guessed
they were not, while hoping that they were. Anyhow,
he would have to stop. His nerves fluttered as he wondered
if he would be able to stop.</p>

<p>He had watched Matt as he brought the <i>Sprite</i> alongside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
the <i>San Bruno</i>. As he remembered it, Matt had
begun to play with the levers before the launch was
very near the larger craft.</p>

<p>Matt, it will be recalled, had done this in order to let
the <i>Sprite</i> glide noiselessly to her berth. Ping repeated
the man&oelig;uvre, and McGlory danced around on
the house boat's deck, fuming at the delay caused by the
halted motor.</p>

<p>The <i>San Bruno</i> was almost bunting into the stern of
<i>Sprite</i> as the two boys made flying leaps to get aboard.
The impact of their bodies came within one of swamping
the little craft, and Matt stumbled to the steering wheel
and got busy without losing an instant.</p>

<p>Ping slid backward over the midship thwart, yielding
his place meekly and gladly; and then, with McGlory, he
watched while Motor Matt plucked the <i>Sprite</i> out of
harm's way.</p>

<p>It was so neatly done that Ping's heart swelled within
him, and he slapped his hands and said glad things in
Chinese. One touch of Motor Matt's hand, and the
demon stopped pounding. A hum as of an industrious
hive of bees came from under the hood, and the launch
gathered itself together and flung onward with a fresh
burst of speed.</p>

<p>The <i>San Bruno</i>, those aboard her still under the impression
that Landers was on the <i>Sprite</i>&mdash;perhaps, in
the darkness, mistaking Ping for their renegade comrade&mdash;continued
to give pursuit.</p>

<p>It was a hopeless chase, however, and when the <i>Sprite</i>
gained her old berth at the Tiburon wharf the <i>San
Bruno</i> had given up and turned back into the night.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">A NEW TWIST&mdash;BY GEORGE.</p>


<p>"Speak to me about that!" gulped McGlory, as he,
and Matt and Ping climbed out of the <i>Sprite</i> to the top
of the wharf. "Little Slant-eyes has starred himself.
But how he ever did it stumps me."</p>

<p>"How did you do it, Ping?" asked Matt, leaning
against the post to which he had secured the launch and
peering across the water to see if there was any sign of
the <i>San Bruno</i> in the gloom.</p>

<p>"By jee-clickets," bubbled Ping, "me allee same big
high China boy. Fightee like Sam Hill, workee allee
same. Whoosh!"</p>

<p>"And that's the way he did it," commented McGlory.</p>

<p>"My no savvy," admitted Ping. "Plenty quick 'Melican
man takee boat, plenty quick him dlop ovelbo'd,
plenty quick my come back to othel boatee. No savvy
ally mo."</p>

<p>"You did well, anyhow," said Matt.</p>

<p>"Awri'. My workee fo' Motol Matt allee time."</p>

<p>"What now, pard?" asked McGlory. "We got out of
that bunch of excitement with ground to spare, but why
do we tie up here? Why don't we keep right on to
'Frisco? George is going to hand us five apiece, you
know," he added, with a laugh, "providing we fork over
this ten thousand before the steamer sails for Honolulu."</p>

<p>"George will have to wait while we send some officers
out to that house boat," said Matt.</p>

<p>"You haven't an idea those three tinhorns will have
the nerve to go back to the house boat, have you?"</p>

<p>"They may, to pick up their traps. That makes it
necessary for us to act quickly, if we are to accomplish
anything. Come on, and we'll hunt up police headquarters."</p>

<p>Ping hesitated.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you, chink?" asked McGlory.
"Ain't you coming with us?"</p>

<p>"No can do," replied Ping. "My no leavee boat. Mebbyso
my makee sleep in boat, huh? Plenty fine place.
My no lettee 'Melican man lun away with him some mo'."</p>

<p>"Stay here if you want to, Ping," answered Matt.</p>

<p>"That's the heathen of it," grunted McGlory. "He'd
rather bunk in the bottom of the <i>Sprite</i>, with his legs
doubled over the thwarts, than to rest on a good mattress
like a Christian."</p>

<p>"Here's one Christian that's ready to rest," said Matt.</p>

<p>"And here's another," added McGlory. "Listen. Do
you recollect that we haven't had a feed since we took
that quick-order lunch at noon?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, no wonder we're hungry and fagged. Let's
make rush work of this police business, and then tumble
into our blankets."</p>

<p>It was an hour before they got a detail of officers
started in a launch for the house boat, and incidentally
looking for the <i>San Bruno</i>; and half an hour longer
before they dropped into bed and went to sleep.</p>

<p>They awoke late next morning, which was to be expected,
considering the hour at which they retired, and
their exhausted condition; and they would not have got
up when they did had a smart summons not been
pounded on their door.</p>

<p>"Speak to me about this," snorted McGlory, sitting
up and yawning. "Who's got the nerve to hammer on
that door before we've done anything but go to bed and
turn over?"</p>

<p>"It's been several hours since we went to bed, Joe,"
laughed Matt, pointing to the sunlight streaming through
the window. "The sun looks to be nearly noon-high.
Who's there?" he called, as the knocking at the door
went on.</p>

<p>"Officer from headquarters," came the response from
the hall.</p>

<p>"Sufferin' horn toads!" exclaimed McGlory, leaping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
out of bed and hurrying to the door. "Mebby he's
come to tell us Big John, Kinky, and Ross have been
bagged."</p>

<p>But the officer had no such report to make.</p>

<p>"We found the house boat deserted, when we went out
to her last night," he said, coming into the room. "Two
men were left aboard of her and the rest of the detail
went nosing around the bay looking for the <i>San Bruno</i>."</p>

<p>"Did you find the launch?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;tied up at Sausalito. No sign of the three men
whom you described; but three passengers took a train
from Sausalito, in the small hours of the morning, and
it may be that they are the fellows we were after. If
they were, then they have made good their escape."</p>

<p>"A nice handful of cold fish you're giving us, officer,"
said McGlory.</p>

<p>"Can't help it," returned the officer. "We did the
best we could."</p>

<p>"Who owns that house boat?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"A gentleman who lives in Oakland. He rents the
<i>Griselda</i> for part of the season when he's not using her
himself."</p>

<p>"He rented her to that precious outfit of crooks and
tinhorns, did he?" struck in McGlory, scrambling into
his clothes. "What sort of a gent is that Oakland man,
anyway?"</p>

<p>"He's all right," declared the officer. "We talked with
him over the phone, a while ago, and told him to send
some one to look after the boat. He said he rented the
<i>Griselda</i> to a stranger named Higgins, who paid him
eighty dollars in advance for a month's rent."</p>

<p>"Higgins!" muttered McGlory. "That's another label
for Big John. Wonder how many names Red-whiskers
has got?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Matt, "it's too bad, officer, but, as you
say, it can't be helped."</p>

<p>"We've placed your description of the rascals on file,"
finished the officer, as he turned to leave, "and if they
ever show up here, or in 'Frisco, again, they'll be run in."</p>

<p>"Mebby," qualified McGlory. "Tie a string to that
remark, officer."</p>

<p>"We'll do the best we can to keep watch for them,
anyhow," averred the officer.</p>

<p>Motor Matt and McGlory had a late&mdash;a very late&mdash;breakfast;
then, after Matt had had a good meal put in
a paper bag for Ping, the two boys started for the <i>Sprite</i>.</p>

<p>To their surprise, neither Ping nor the <i>Sprite</i> were
where they had been left; nor could any inquiries develop
their whereabouts.</p>

<p>"It's good-by, Ping," laughed McGlory. "I reckon he
made up his mind that he didn't want to work for you
any longer, Matt."</p>

<p>"I'm glad of it, Joe, if that's really the case," answered
Matt. "I haven't the least notion in the world
what I could have found for the Chinaman to do. But I
can't think that he's pulled out for good. He seemed
too anxious to tie to me to break away so suddenly as
that."</p>

<p>"Well, wherever he went he went in the <i>Sprite</i>. We
can feel sure that Big John and his pals haven't had
anything to do with the chink's disappearance. They're
too busy getting themselves out of sight, pard, to bother
with any one else."</p>

<p>Matt and McGlory went to the ferry house and caught
the next boat for 'Frisco. On the way across the bay
Matt gave Ping's breakfast to a little chap who looked
as though he needed it.</p>

<p>McGlory carried the satchel with the ten thousand
dollars. It had been glued to him ever since he got
hands on it aboard the house boat.</p>

<p>By one o'clock the boys were at the hotel inquiring
of the frowsy-looking clerk as to whether "Mr. Thompson"
was in his room. Both boys thought the inquiry
rather needless, but concluded to put it as a mere formality.
They were a good deal taken aback, therefore,
when the clerk informed them that Mr. Thompson had
gone out about nine o'clock and hadn't returned.</p>

<p>"Now what?" muttered McGlory, taking Matt's arm
and leading him off into a corner. "We've got George's
money, but no George. Do you think, pard, that he
raised enough money on something to pay his passage to
Honolulu?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not, Joe," answered Matt. "He wouldn't
leave town until he had learned more about that ten
thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"But he promised to stay here! Still, as for that, he
always was a fine hand at making promises. If George
isn't here, I don't reckon we're obliged to hang out in
this honkatonk. The more I see of it, the more I'm
sorry the earthquake didn't give it a few extra shakes
and put it out of business. We'll go to some other hotel,
and on our way there we'll just step into a telegraph
office and shoot a few reassuring words to Uncle Dan."</p>

<p>"We could make them more reassuring, Joe," suggested
Matt, "if we waited to find George before sending
the telegram."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't bet a whole lot, Matt, that we're going to
find him."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, we are, and perhaps quicker than you think."</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, they found George a good deal
sooner than even Matt had any idea they would, for he
was on the sidewalk, making for the hotel door, as Matt
and McGlory passed out.</p>

<p>Young Lorry was quite a swell-looking boy, togged
out in another suit, but there was an air about him that
suggested conceit, carelessness of others' feelings, and a
haughty confidence in himself that was too plain for a
favorable impression.</p>

<p>Lorry was surprised at seeing Matt and McGlory, and,
quite naturally, Matt and McGlory were not only surprised,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
but delighted to come upon the missing youth so
soon.</p>

<p>"Howdy, George?" called McGlory. "We've just
been asking for you."</p>

<p>"You have&mdash;not," retorted Lorry. "You didn't want
to see me, and you know it." He turned to a policeman
who was standing behind him, and who, up to that moment,
had escaped the notice of Matt and the cowboy.
"There they are, officer," went on Lorry. "Arrest them."</p>

<p>Matt and McGlory were stunned.</p>

<p>"Arrest us?" queried Matt. "For what?"</p>

<p>"For trying to run away with ten thousand dollars
belonging to me," asserted Lorry. "You were to bring
it back last night, and you didn't. Arrest them, why
don't you, officer? What are you standing there like
that for?"</p>

<p>"There are always two sides to a story," said the policeman.
"We've heard your side, young man, and
now we'll hear the other."</p>

<p>Matt's amazement remained with him, but McGlory's
rapidly dispelled.</p>

<p>"A new twist&mdash;by George," remarked McGlory dryly.
"When you've known him as long as I have, Matt, you'll
not be surprised at anything he does. Come back into
this hotel with us, officer," the cowboy went on to the
policeman, "and we'll tell you all you want to know,
and perhaps more. But hang on to that false alarm
who was towing you this way. He may try to bolt before
we get through."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">ANOTHER TWIST&mdash;BY MATT AND M'GLORY.</p>


<p>"I don't like your attitude," said Lorry haughtily, to
the officer when they were all in the office.</p>

<p>"Naturally," grinned the policeman, "I'm not responsible
for that."</p>

<p>"Well," ordered George, "search them, take the money
and give it to me. That's all I want. They've got it, I
know they have."</p>

<p>"You bet we've got it, George," said McGlory, opening
the satchel and fishing out the bunch of bills. "How
does that look to you? Everything's all shipshape, too,
even to the name of the bank on the wrapper."</p>

<p>George gave a cry of delight and started forward.</p>

<p>"See him!" cried McGlory, calmly pushing his cousin
back with one hand and thrusting the money into his
breast pocket with the other.</p>

<p>"I want that, McGlory," snapped George.</p>

<p>"I know you do, but you don't get it."</p>

<p>"Come, come," put in the officer. "There's a whole
lot of money in that roll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ten thousand, officer."</p>

<p>"Does it belong to this young fellow?"</p>

<p>"Not that anybody knows. He stole it, and we've just
got it back from a bunch of crooks who lifted it from
him."</p>

<p>The officer frowned.</p>

<p>"Ah," he muttered, "this is beginning to look serious.
He says you two boys are thieves, and now you're accusing
him of being a thief."</p>

<p>"There's a difference, officer," said McGlory.</p>

<p>"Difference?"</p>

<p>"Sure. We can prove our case, and he can't prove
his."</p>

<p>"How'll you prove it?"</p>

<p>"Why, by sending a telegram to this young chap's
father, in Madison, Wisconsin. Police headquarters will
keep the money until an answer is received to that
message."</p>

<p>Lorry went pale and began to tremble.</p>

<p>"I won't have it that way," he declared hotly.</p>

<p>"I guess you will," said the officer grimly. "That's a
fair way to settle this business, and you ought to abide
by your father's orders if these other young fellows are
willing to."</p>

<p>"They've got some game they're trying to play,"
scowled George, "and I won't stand for it. I'll make you
all sorry for this," he threatened, turning away.</p>

<p>The officer grabbed him before he had taken two steps.</p>

<p>"Where you going, Lorry?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Take your hands off of me!" ordered Lorry, striking
feebly at the big fist that had collared him. "I'm going
where I please, and you've no right to interfere with me."</p>

<p>"You're going to headquarters," asserted the policeman,
"and it's there you'll stay until an answer is returned
to that telegram."</p>

<p>"You gave the game a twist, George," grinned
McGlory, "and now here's another twist, by Motor Matt
and me."</p>

<p>"What made you think of such a foolish move,
George?" asked Matt. "You didn't really think we were
trying to steal that money, did you?"</p>

<p>"How'd I know?" snarled Lorry sullenly. "I haven't
a very good opinion of McGlory, and if you travel
around with him I can't have a much better opinion of
you."</p>

<p>Motor Matt was disgusted.</p>

<p>"McGlory and I will go to headquarters with you,
officer," said he, "and explain this to the chief. The
quicker that telegram is sent, the better."</p>

<p>The straightforward story which Matt and the cowboy
told the chief of police aroused nothing but pity and contempt
for young Lorry.</p>

<p>A telegram was forwarded to George's father, at
Madison, and all three of the boys were treated as
guests, rather than as prisoners, by the chief while they
awaited an answer to the message.</p>

<p>This interval Matt put in to good advantage. In his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
memorandum book he had the number of the baggage
check which had been turned over to Big John, and
also the name of the railroad by which it had been
issued.</p>

<p>At Matt's suggestion, the chief sent a couple of officers
to the depot to examine the trunk, and also to warn
the railroad officials to call a policeman at once in case
any man presented the baggage check and tried to claim
the trunk.</p>

<p>In two hours the two officers were back, highly elated.
They had opened the trunk and had found it to contain,
securely packed in a lot of clothing, a very complete
burglar's kit.</p>

<p>"We can understand now," remarked the chief, "why
those rascals were so anxious to secure the trunk check.
In order to claim the trunk without the check, they would
have had to identify the property. They would have
looked nice describing that set of burglar's tools, wouldn't
they? My word for it, no one will ever show up at the
station and try to claim that trunk. After what has happened,
it would be altogether too dangerous."</p>

<p>The trunk and the burglar's kit were confiscated by the
police.</p>

<p>It was evening before McGlory received a telegram
from his Uncle Dan. The message was a long one, and
entirely satisfactory to the authorities, even if not so
pleasing to Lorry.</p>

<p>The message ran as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Thank you for what you have done. My desire is to
have you take charge of money and to bring George back
home. This Motor Matt, who has already been of so
much aid, might be willing to come with you and help
still further. Use as much of the money as needed for
your expenses. Prefer to have George brought home by
you than to send officers for him. Bring him whether he
wants to come or not. We will take care of him when
he gets here."</p></blockquote>

<p>"I'll not go," declared Lorry, when the telegram was
read to him.</p>

<p>"I guess you will, old chap," said McGlory. "There'll
be two of us, and if we have to, you know, we can carry
you to the train."</p>

<p>If Lorry's looks reflected his feelings, his frame of
mind was anything but enviable. As a precaution, he
was to be left at police headquarters until train time.</p>

<p>"You're going along, eh, pard?" asked McGlory, as
soon as he had got Matt where he could talk to him privately.</p>

<p>"It's a sudden turn for me," answered Matt. "Yesterday,
at this time, I hadn't any more idea of going
to Wisconsin than I had of going to China."</p>

<p>"What difference does it make to you where you are,
Matt, so long as you're making a little good money?"</p>

<p>"Money isn't everything, Joe."</p>

<p>"No more it ain't, but in this case, Matt, you're helping
a couple of mighty good people&mdash;and by that, I mean
Uncle Dan and Aunt Mollie."</p>

<p>"If I go, McGlory, it will be to help somebody else."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Why, George, himself. I think there's good stuff in
him if it could be brought out."</p>

<p>"Hear him! Matt, George is as near a false alarm as
you'll find anywhere. He's not more than half baked; if
he wasn't all of that, do you think he'd have tried to
have us arrested for stealing that money?"</p>

<p>"He's all worked up, now, and has been for quite a
while," explained Matt. "When a fellow's in that condition,
Joe, he's not wholly responsible for what he does."</p>

<p>"Talk about making a man of George is all a summer
breeze, Matt. He hasn't a thing to build on, if you
count out the cigarette habit."</p>

<p>Matt mused for a little while.</p>

<p>"He likes motor boats, I believe you said, Joe?" he
queried at last.</p>

<p>"Well, yes," laughed McGlory, "a liking for boats
seems to run in the family. It was a motor boat, you
<i>sabe</i>, that started George on his last dash for the Pacific
Slope and freedom. But what of that?"</p>

<p>"I was thinking that a course of motor boats might
develop George into a different person."</p>

<p>McGlory whistled. Then he laughed.</p>

<p>"You're over my head, Matt," said he, "but that's
nothing. The point is, will you go? I don't care what
sort of a fool notion takes you, just so you see me
through to the end of the trip."</p>

<p>"I'll go," replied Matt.</p>

<p>McGlory reached out his hand.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_MAN-EATER" id="THE_MAN-EATER">THE MAN-EATER.</a></h2>


<p>I was traveling on duty from Kolicaad on the coast to an
inland station, by a road, crossing the Western Ghauts,
which was entirely new to me. Two bullock carts carried
my kit; my half a dozen servants marched alongside, while
I headed the procession on horseback. Before leaving Kolicaad
I had ascertained that the route was furnished throughout
with travelers' rest houses; that after the first three
marches the country became wild; that a few coffee plantations&mdash;managed
by Europeans&mdash;lay scattered about the loftier
hills, and that from the third stage&mdash;Cerrianaad&mdash;right away
to the further foot of the Ghauts, I would traverse heavy
jungle, said to be swarming with wild animals. This last
piece of information would have gladdened a seasoned shikarrie&mdash;or
sportsman&mdash;but to me it was immaterial, as I was
not much given that way. I was only nineteen years of age,
owned nothing in the shape of firearms, and had yet to
acquire that love of big game shooting which took such
strong hold of me in after years.</p>

<p>After we passed Cerrianaad the country became more
hilly, the track zigzagged and curved, the dense jungle shut
in the road, hamlets grew fewer and further between, and
the only natives to be seen abroad were wayfarers&mdash;all in
large bodies&mdash;who told us that they purposely made up
parties for the sake of security. I could see that my followers
were fast becoming uneasy; they huddled together,
while the bullock drivers frantically urged their sluggish
cattle into keeping pace with me on horseback. We reached
the next stage&mdash;Wuddagherry&mdash;without adventure; but here
we learned something that well-nigh drove my servants into
a panic, and made me ardently wish that I had a gun of any
description in my hands. Soon after our arrival the head
man of Wuddagherry hamlet came to me and asked if I intended
going on to Malanaad the following day. I understood
him, for I had already picked up the local language.</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied.</p>

<p>"You must take care to reach it as early as possible, sir;
for it is a long stage, fifteen miles; the road is difficult, and
very dangerous."</p>

<p>"How is it more dangerous than from Cerrianaad to this?"
I inquired with surprise; for no one at Kolicaad had said
anything about the stage in question being particularly perilous.</p>

<p>"Almost opposite to Malanaad hamlet, sir, about a quarter
of a mile off the road to the right, an English gentleman
has lately commenced clearing the jungle to make a coffee
plantation. He has built an iron house and iron lines for his
coolies."</p>

<p>"That's good news, head man: I shall certainly go and
stay the night with the gentleman rather than at the Malanaad
bungalow&mdash;all by myself."</p>

<p>"But, sir," continued the villager, now speaking in an awed
whisper, "a man-eating tiger that is supposed to have wandered
up from the low country on the other side is haunting
the plantation! The Malanaad hamlet is walled in; the
people do not stir out after dark, so the tiger is preying on
the gentleman's coolies, who are not so protected."</p>

<p>Danger, indeed! I had heard and read of man eaters, but
had never encountered one. What if the demon happened
to be lurking by the roadside as we passed? What if he
should pop out on to us? What could I do? Nothing!</p>

<p>"Is the gentleman by himself?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; he has a son of about thirteen years, and a little
daughter, much younger. I saw them all when they rested
here on their way up."</p>

<p>"No lady?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; but there was an old ayah who attended on the
little girl."</p>

<p>I felt sorry for the isolated Englishman, especially when I
thought of his two children, leading a lonely life in a jungle,
cut off from the society of those of their own color. Knowing
how gladly they would welcome me, I should certainly
have claimed the planter's hospitality for one night at least
had not the villager's news about the tiger put me off the
idea. No, I was not going to run any risk: I would go
straight to the Malanaad bungalow.</p>

<p>After dismissing the head man, I summoned my trembling
followers, heartened them as best I could, and added that we
would start sufficiently early in the morning to insure our
reaching Malanaad well before sundown.</p>

<p>Accordingly, we set out soon after dawn, and proceeded
in close order, keeping a bright lookout on all sides. The
road wound, dipped, and climbed; the thick jungle lined it
on both flanks, and frequently formed a canopy over our
heads. We heard occasional weird cries in the forest, but
saw nothing; and we met no one till the afternoon, when,
all at once, as we cleared a bend, I saw a narrow road
branching off to the right, and three figures standing under
a tree just where the two tracks joined. One was a European
lad of some thirteen years, the other a flaxen-haired
little girl of eight or so&mdash;both wearing sun hats&mdash;and the
third an old ayah, or maid; the planter's children, no doubt,
with the maid in attendance. But why there&mdash;a quarter of
a mile from their home? Why with only a solitary old native
woman, while a man-eating tiger, not to say other
dangerous animals, perhaps crouched in the very thicket
behind them? My blood curdled as I thought it. No sooner
did they behold me than all three ran forward.</p>

<p>"Halloa! Who are you?" I asked, dismounting and signing
my carts to halt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, we are so glad to see you!" answered the boy,
eagerly and breathlessly. "My name is Jimmy Simpson:
this is my sister Maud, and the old woman is her nurse. We
are Mr. Simpson's children: we live up at the plantation,
and&mdash;and we are in great trouble."</p>

<p>"What trouble?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"A man-eating tiger commenced coming here a few nights
ago, and has killed several of our coolies. My father has
not been able to shoot it. Many of the coolies ran away;
and, as father could not make the plantation without men,
he and Pote have gone down the other side of the hills to
get some."</p>

<p>"Who's Pote?"</p>

<p>"Father's assistant. They went the day before yesterday,
leaving us in the care of the servants and the few coolies
who still stayed. That night the tiger came about eight
o'clock, the same time as before, and killed a man who had
gone out of doors. The next morning every coolie and all
our house servants ran away: they said they were too frightened
to stop any longer. But the ayah wouldn't leave Maud.
We are afraid of spending another night by ourselves, so,
as the tiger does not show himself till about eight o'clock,
we came out here, and have been waiting all the afternoon in
hopes of meeting some one who would stay at the bungalow
with us. Father won't be back for a week. Oh, sir, do
come and stay with us!" he concluded pleadingly.</p>

<p>I thought that if I did halt here&mdash;even for a week&mdash;and
I explained the reason to my superiors, they would not blame
me. It was against human nature to leave these poor children
alone in their fix. I did not see how I could suggest
their abandoning the house, with all their father's property
in it, and accompanying me to the comparative safety of the
Malanaad bungalow&mdash;the very fact of Jimmy Simpson's
expressing no such wish barred the idea. I therefore decided
to give them my companionship&mdash;little though it might
afford in the shape of protection. So, telling my people to
go on to the travelers' bungalow, I turned up the side road
with the children.</p>

<p>In the centre of a clearing stood a corrugated iron house,
with a high-pitched roof, and a veranda running all round,
above which opened some ventilating windows. Several
trees had been allowed to stand close to the house&mdash;evidently
to give shade&mdash;while at the back was a range of out-houses
for servants, and two long rows of "lines" for the
coolies&mdash;all built of the same material as the main house.
Excepting the high ventilators, every door and window was
closed, and not a sound save that of our footsteps broke the
reigning stillness. Young Simpson unlocked a door, and
we entered the bungalow. The ayah brought me some refreshing
drink, which was very welcome after my journey,
and I chatted for some time with the children, with whom
I soon became fast friends.</p>

<p>"Well," said I at length, "I must leave you for an hour
or so. I have got to see my things safely stowed away at
the travelers' bungalow. Then I'll trot back here for the
night with some of my men."</p>

<p>"Please don't be longer than you can help, Mr. Geoffrey!"
begged the lad.</p>

<p>"I'll be as quick as I can," I replied. "Be ready to open
the door when you see us approaching."</p>

<p>And I hurried away.</p>

<p>My followers, however, were obdurate, and no amount of
threats or coaxing would induce them to budge from the
travelers' bungalow. During my absence the man in charge,
and the villagers, had been telling them all about the tiger,
and they flatly refused to accompany me to the plantation
house. I had no alternative, therefore, but to go alone.</p>

<p>I must confess to a strong sensation of nervousness as,
with lantern in hand, I set out on my return journey to the
Simpsons'. But I had picked up an idea somewhere that a
man-eating tiger was peculiarly regular as regarded the time
of his visits to the locality he preyed on. Jimmy had said
that this brute appeared at eight o'clock or thereabouts; so,
it now being only a little past seven, I imagined that I had
forestalled the tiger. I reached the clearing, saw the light
shining through the upper ventilator windows, reconnoitred
as well as the darkness would allow, listened intently, and
then pushed boldly across.</p>

<p>I had hardly got halfway ere I heard Jimmy's voice, muffled
and indistinct, from within the building.</p>

<p>"All right, Jimmy!" I answered, dashing on. "Here I
am! Open the door!"</p>

<p>"Climb! Climb!" I now plainly heard him cry. "The
tiger's close by somewhere!"</p>

<p>The words temporarily paralyzed me. I looked to see
the monster shoot into the rays of my lantern; I already
felt his fangs at my throat! He must have observed my
approach, and concealed himself&mdash;to pounce on me! Jimmy
must have marked the man&oelig;uvre, and had shouted a warning
in his childish way! With the beast at the door, so to
speak, of course I did not expect the boy to open it: before
I could slip in the tiger would probably be up, and either
grab me or enter the house. No; the boy was quite right in
keeping the door shut.</p>

<p>These thoughts flashed through my mind in a moment: the
next, nerved by despair, and roused to action by Jimmy's
reiterated cry of "Climb! Climb!" I glanced wildly about
me and found myself close to one of the shady trees already
alluded to. It was a moderately sized tree, with a smooth,
straight stem, and much foliage at the top. Dropping my
lantern&mdash;fortunately, without upsetting it&mdash;I threw myself
on that trunk, and frantically shinned up. I was just in
time: I had barely got out of harm's way ere, with a
hideous roar, a long, lanky, mangy-looking tiger squirmed
round the corner of the house, came in a series of bounds to
the tree, and then, rearing on end, tried to hook me down!
I could hear his claws tearing the bark; I expected the cruel
talons to pierce my flesh; but luckily he could not reach me,
and I hauled myself up among the branches into comparative
safety. It now remained to be seen whether the beast could
and would follow me. At the time I knew nothing of the
tiger's climbing powers; so I watched my enemy in an agony
of doubt&mdash;to be inexpressibly relieved when I realized that
he could not do it! He was old&mdash;as most man-eaters are:
he hung on to the base of the stem, but, after many ineffectual
attempts, he desisted: the task was beyond him: he
was unable to draw himself up!</p>

<p>For the present I was safe, then, and had time to look
about me. Taking my position in the centre of the tree, I
topped the veranda roof, and I could almost see in through
one of the ventilator windows; but a good six feet yawned
between the inmost tree twig and the veranda eave; a gap
that I could not cover even had I good foothold to spring
from. Nothing remained, therefore, but to make the best
of it, and trust to the feline sneaking off at daylight. Accordingly,
I was about seeking a comfortable branch to spend
the night on when Jimmy called, "Mr. Geoffrey!"</p>

<p>"Halloa!" I shouted in reply; "I'm safe up the tree,
Jimmy, thanks to your warning."</p>

<p>"But you are not safe!" he wailed hysterically.</p>

<p>"Why, where's the danger? The brute has tried to climb
the tree, but failed: he can't get at me."</p>

<p>"Yes, he can, if he thinks of the wood stack!"</p>

<p>"What wood stack?"</p>

<p>"There, at the end of the veranda, just round the corner!
If he climbs by it on to the veranda roof, he can jump from
there into the tree! I've only just thought of it!"</p>

<p>My lantern rays did not penetrate so far. I peered
through the gloom in the direction indicated, and could
dimly make out a number of log ends projecting beyond the
side wall, and heaped to the full height of the veranda itself.
Clearly, then, if the tiger thought of that stack he would
certainly climb it, come along the veranda roof to the tree,
spring across the gap, seize and carry me with him to the
ground! As I contemplated these probabilities I nigh yielded
to despair: I broke into a cold perspiration, and I murmured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
a prayer for aid. That my prayer was answered is proved
by my now living to tell this story. But I had yet to get out
of my fix. I was given little leisure to reflect, for the tiger&mdash;as
if Jimmy's words had given him the hint&mdash;walked off
and disappeared round the corner; a scrambling, scratching
sound followed, and before I could well believe my eyes,
there came the brute, sneaking along the inclined plane of the
veranda roof!</p>

<p>Could I&mdash;after warning Jimmy to unfasten the door&mdash;slip
down the tree and dash into the house? No; though the
varmint could not climb I felt sure he could drop, and that
almost before I touched ground he would be upon me. The
ugly cat crawled along the sloped iron sheeting, halted
abreast of the tree, and set up a hoarse purr on spotting me&mdash;cowering
amid the branches. He crept closer and closer
to the eave till he could come no further&mdash;then gathered
himself up for a spring! He strained and strained; I expected
to see him shoot across and dig both teeth and claws
into me; yet he came not! I stared at the beast in a wild
fascination of terror. I remember&mdash;at that awful moment&mdash;being
struck by his aged and unkempt appearance; I remember
hearing the purr gradually give place to a growl of
anger, and then all at once the truth broke on me: that outward
and upward spring was beyond the man-eater; he
would not attempt the feat; I was safe!</p>

<p>My courage revived, and with it came a fierce longing to
destroy my tormentor, whose foul breath reached and sickened
me even at that distance. Now, another thought suddenly
struck me: was there possibly a gun of some kind in
the house? Hardly; for if so I should probably have seen
it, or Jimmy would have offered me the weapon when I left
that afternoon. Anyhow, I would find out.</p>

<p>"Jimmy!" I bawled, causing the tiger to start angrily.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Geoffrey?"</p>

<p>"The tiger has come on to the veranda roof&mdash;as you said;
but he can't manage to spring into the tree, so I'm safe!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so glad! I was&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I say, have you a gun?"</p>

<p>"Father took one rifle with him; the other is in the case,
locked up, to keep us from meddling with it."</p>

<p>"Are there cartridges?"</p>

<p>"Yes; a beltful in the case."</p>

<p>"Where's the key?"</p>

<p>"Father has it."</p>

<p>"Jimmy," I rejoined imploringly, "break open the case,
load the rifle, open the door a wee bit, and fire at the beast
through the veranda roof. The bullet will penetrate&mdash;I'm
sure. He is crouching in a line with the ventilator, just short
of the eave, so you'll know where to aim. I'll make it right
with your father."</p>

<p>"What's the good?" half whimpered the boy. "I don't
know how to use a rifle."</p>

<p>Here was a facer! What more was left? But my brain
was busy, and I determined to die hard. Green as I was,
shaken as I was, I resolved to try and shoot the tiger myself!</p>

<p>"Jimmy, do you think you could manage to pass me the
rifle?"</p>

<p>"I will if I can; but how?"</p>

<p>"No use attempting the door&mdash;even while the brute is
on the veranda roof; he'd hear you like a shot, and pounce
down on you before you could wink. But could you reach
the ventilator window from the inside? Don't be afraid;
it is too small for him to get his head and shoulders through,
so he can't touch you."</p>

<p>"But how am I to do it?"</p>

<p>"Can't you go hand-over-hand up the swing rope, with the
rifle and belt slung on you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I can," he answered readily.</p>

<p>"Then you could work along the tie beam and reach the
window, couldn't you?"</p>

<p>"I think so; but even if the window is large enough for
me, how about the tiger outside?"</p>

<p>"Tell you what: get the rifle and cartridge belt, climb
the swing rope, making as little noise as possible, and straddle
along the tie beam to the window. Directly I see you there,
I'll pretend to descend the tree; the brute will either drop to
the earth from where he now is, or go round by the wood
heap; in either case you could scramble out, chuck me the
rifle and belt, and get through the window again before
the tiger is able to remount the veranda by the wood heap;
that is, if he notices you. Leave the rest to me."</p>

<p>The boy was plucky to the backbone, and immediately
agreed to carry out my instructions. Presently I heard a
rending, as of a box being broken open; then succeeded a
silence of several minutes, and finally&mdash;to my joy&mdash;I saw
the lad cautiously peeping over the window sill. Promptly
I made a show of climbing down, energetically shaking the
foliage as I felt my way to the lower branches. My movement
had the desired effect; the tiger raised himself, growled,
and, evidently believing that he had me, down he dropped
with a "thud" to the ground. The coast was clear for
Jimmy!</p>

<p>"Now, Jimmy!" I shouted, frantically reclimbing upward
and inward, "out you get! He's down below!"</p>

<p>Quick as thought Jimmy slipped out the rifle and belt and
proceeded to follow them. With my attention divided between
him and the man-eater, I waited in desperate expectancy,
but try as he would, the boy could not pass
through! He essayed head first, then legs first, then this
way, then that way; no, he failed! In my anxiety I had
momentarily taken my eyes off the animal to watch Jimmy.
On recollecting myself, and looking down again, the brute
was nowhere to be seen! Merciful heaven! where had he
gone? I peered on all sides, striving to probe the gloom
beyond the rays of my still burning lantern, but I could not
see him; the monster had vanished! While a sensation of
superstitious terror threatened to overwhelm me, a smothered
ejaculation of triumph came from Jimmy; I glanced
eagerly in his direction, to find that he had at last succeeded
in getting out! He was in the act of dropping to the
veranda roof, when the scrambling, scratching sound which
I had once before heard that night smote on my ear; the
disappearance of the tiger was no longer a mystery: he was
climbing the wood heap!</p>

<p>"Jimmy!" I shrieked, "get back! For your life get back!
The tiger's climbing the stack!"</p>

<p>Whether the boy heard me, understood me, or not, or
had taken leave of his senses, I could not tell, for, instead of
obeying me, he clutched both rifle and belt, and floundered
down the slope toward the tree! At the same moment I
saw that the tiger had gained the roof, and was approaching
as fast as he could!</p>

<p>"Back! For mercy's sake, back!" I yelled despairingly;
but the next instant the lad&mdash;after giving a hasty glance at
the tiger&mdash;put forth all his young strength and hurled the
rifle in my direction. Mechanically I managed to seize the
piece as it crashed into the branches; the belt followed; I
secured it, and then the plucky boy, scurrying up the inclined
roof, hauled himself to the window and wriggled
through the aperture not half a second before the man-eater
got up to it! Intensely relieved at Jimmy's miraculous
escape, and burning with fury against the accursed animal&mdash;the
cause of all our trouble&mdash;I simply sat there and sent
bullet after bullet into his vile carcass, continuing the fusillade
till he lay limp and lifeless on the veranda roof!</p>

<p>No more need be said. I loved that boy, who had shown
a courage and nerve beyond the wildest dreams of fancy.
I love him now as a man, with a reputation for cool pluck
and presence of mind, the promise of which he so signally
exhibited on the occasion of my story. When Mr. Simpson
returned, and I told him all, the satisfaction I derived by
seeing the tears of admiration that dimmed his eyes as I
described his son's gallantry more than compensated me for
my own somewhat unpleasant share in that ever memorable
adventure.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
